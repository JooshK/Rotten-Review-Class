0," The answer isn't necessarily one way or the other, but Can We Take a Joke? doesn't explore this societal issue with any depth or nuance."
0," Without the rom-com requisites of charm, chemistry, comedy and character, this doesn't even meet low expectations."
0, ...there reaches a point at which such sequences start to take on repetitive and superfluous qualities...
1, The serious handling of each character's rationalisations is what both amuses and unsettles.
0," The third installment in the series has the stale, slightly sour ambiance you'd expect when walking into a summer house that's been shut up for the winter. "
1," Ledger slips into the purple suit as if it were an animal skin for a primal, archetypal dance...Nolan's richly realized adaptation of a modern American mythology fulfills our faith in the material and its interpreters."
0, I'd rather suck the poison out of a rattlesnake fang than submit anyone to this drawn-out drawl fest.
1," It may not have the depth or nuance of the original, but it's still a great story, stylishly told."
0, Von Trier said he wrote this film to help him work out of a deep depression. Now he's put us in one.
1," All these all-singing, all-dancing high-schoolers are downright adorable, and without being annoying about it, either..."
0, Just plain awful.
1," Gifted finds a collective of competent people making a perfectly competent movie -- nothing more, nothing less."
0, So much plot is crammed into the film's relatively lengthy 120 minutes that it can be downright confounding trying to figure out who's a good guy and who's the villain.
1, An inspiring documentary on the legacy of the African-American writer and activist.
0," Adam Sandler seems to just be coasting whatever is left of his career, resigned to the fact that his game was over long ago."
0," Lee's Taking Woodstock serves up so many clichï¿½ï¿½s and stereotypes that it feels like a film made by someone who had never met a real Jew, Vietnam vet, homosexual, or hi"
1," It's so smart, meticulous and 1 that I can only hope it marks the beginning of a provocative new franchise."
1, Repeats the past with less thrilling but more profound results. 
1," Can be seen as an examination of war and nonviolence, but it also begs to be seen - like Birth of a Nation, with its #BlackLivesMatter echoes - in light of contemporary issues."
1," After taking a 1 look at the DVD of Manhattan, it's apparent that this isn't Woody Allen's greatest film. However, it is easily his most beautiful, with breathtaking black & white vistas of the titular city set to Gershwin's 'Rhapsody in Blue.'"
0, The only original writing screenwriter Tyger Williams managed was that adorable first name he invented for himself. 
0, Close-ups of a needle penetrating gnarled toes and a mutant slathered in what I choose to believe is bittersweet chocolate make as much sense as the scary drawings of angry vulvas hiding in a drawer.
0," Alone of all the earnest players in this turgidly euphemistic melodrama, Sheen seems to grasp that the only way you can keep a straight face through this choked-up virginity is to carry it way into camp."
0," The Last Airbender is a joyless, soulless, muddled mess, but the worst part of all doesn't come until the very end. That's when it makes the clear suggestion that two more such movies are in store for us."
0," Joe Wright's Pan is lacking in the fun, excitement, and magic that made earlier adaptations of Peter Pan so endearing and memorable, leaving behind a troubled prequel that even kids will more than likely find to be a tremendous bore."
1," It's surprisingly affecting, but there's a tendency to telegraph ... pivotal emotional moments that in a way lessens their effect. It's a tribute to the film's overall craft and, especially, its cast, that it's as much a winner as it is."
1," Technically wonderful, the loose narrative of I am Belfast shows off Cousins' profound sense of landscape through story."
1," A mix of martial arts, which includes Muay Thai, kung fu and Samurai swordplay, that was Jaa's inspiration for making the movie in the first place."
1," Winkler's musical valentine to Cole Porter and his genius sets just the right tone, a harmonious blend of intelligence and sentiment, intensified by a song score to sigh for and the best film performance of Kevin Kline's estimable career."
1, A fine film that stands on its own merits and one that does an admirable job of staying faithful to the spirit of its source material.
0, It's probably foolish to wish that Nicolas Cage would once again make movies as good as Adaptation and Leaving Las Vegas. But is it too much to ask that he go back to the comparative glory days of Con Air and The Rock?
0," Little more than a slipshod, trashy, sometimes exploitative thriller."
0," More country pop than country classic, Country Strong puts its characters through the dramatic wringer ... but only skims the surface of their emotional minefields."
1," There is a great deal more than magic and laughs...it also says a hatful of bunnies about audiences and the pervasive, decadent state of entertainment in our society. "
0," The characters are still engaging, but the story is a mess this time around."
1," ... a thinking-person's action flick, with survival a priority at every turn while all the players are manipulating each other... believe Theron was born to play her part."
0," Well crafted, to be sure, but light on genuine emotional depth, the material is aching to find meaning, but falls short"
1, Brings the horror stories of everyday life down to a recognizable level.
1," Mostly smart, spring-taut, low-budget indie drama."
1," It prompts us to admit, however sadly, that childlike innocence is not sufficient in a world like ours%u2014that we need to be wise as serpents even as we remain innocent as doves."
0, It's not the horrible mess I thought it would be but it's not enough to redeem itself and be more than deficient. [Full review in Spanish]
0, [A] mixed bag of a country music comeback fable. 
1, A hilarious adaptation of an equally hysterical series.
0," Armed Response doesn't deserve a response for how bad it is, but you should know before you choose to see it."
0, I'm sure Cameron Crowe will bounce back and make some more great films... but most will acknowledge that Aloha is a failure.
0, Underworld is another movie fantasy that thinks having no sense of humour is a requirement for taking itself seriously.
0," Gory with a hint of humour, this pretty much does what it says on the tin."
0," The Dinner is two hours of unrelenting nastiness, steeped in the trappings of extreme wealth and the toxic privilege it affords."
1," Not only for cat people, then, but you need to be that way inclined if you are to be entranced by all of the many shots that just show cats being cats."
0, Why don't we leave the Coen Brothers' 1950's Hollywood studio comedy walking on air? 
1," Abraham hasn't proved that aliens exist with his film, but he certainly makes you think about it."
0, The Catholic Church was wise to want nothing to do with The Devil Inside. Everyone else should follow suit.
1, It says something about Deutch's appeal that she does manage to pull the story from the vexing hole it digs itself into.
1," It's the stuff of formula ... [b]ut director Christian Carion, who co-wrote the film with Eric Assous, manages to keep you interested by gradually shifting the nature of the relationship between the old man and his protege."
0," It appears impossibly mannered, a cross between knock-off Dennis Potter and an episode of Bread."
1," Keeps you on the edge of your seat thanks to Jakob Cedergren's engaging performance and the vital sound editing by Oskar Skriver. Regardless of where you think the film is going, Mï¿½ï¿½ller has a few tricks up his sleeve that you won't see comi"
0, You can smell the frying cheese from a mile away.
0," Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk might well mark a significant step forward in the evolution of filmmaking. However, important is not necessarily the same as good and this movie, despite its best intentions, is ultimately just not very good."
1," The crowd cheers. Vin Diesel glowers. At almost 2 1/2 hours it isn't exactly fast, but it's as furious as hell."
1, The Descendants gives George Clooney another fine role as a comfortable man shaken by the realities of life.
1," Watching this small-time Melbourne crime family unravel under the weight of their overconfidence is riveting, as Australian writer-director David Michod takes his time methodically detailing their self-destruction."
0, Presents itself as the first SAT protest film... but predictably becomes a toothless pep rally for business as usual...
1," Thanks primarily to its inventive shooting style, Cloverfield is a terrifically frightening film."
0, nothing we haven't seen before
0," The Kingdom uses explosive current events as the starting point for a fictional film that strains to stir emotions, seemingly instill tolerance and be a bloody action flick. It's a manipulative, mannered film that often fails."
1, Kutcher bears a striking resemblance to Jobs and manages to embody him in full. It is an often emotional performance that could have very easily been turned into a characterization.
0," While good company might make or break a night out, sadly it can't save ""Fun Mom Dinner"" from being more than just fitfully funny."
0," Director Camille Delamarre does a sloppy job of piecing everything together, and nobody on screen seems invested in what is going on. The feeling from the audience is mutual."
1, How could we hate or humiliate Lennon any more than he'd been trained to hate and humiliate himself?
0," The biggest problem is the script, which rarely rings true and is full of trite little phrases."
1," This mix of issue film and character profile is, like its predecessor, glossy and digestible in its execution, a well-produced, informative, engaging and encouraging feature."
1," Dom is effusive with self-destructive charisma, the kind of loose cannon you'd follow into an all-night bender in spite of your better judgment."
0," Golly, is it too much to expect more character dimension than this from the director of ""Schindler's List""?"
1," There are wonderful stretches in Ned Rifle when his flat, affected, hyper-literate dialogue pings just as strongly as it did in his 1990s prime."
0," With just a few script tweaks, this long, dull and downright bizarre bore-a-thon could have been more aptly named Uranus Numbing."
1," Stephen Chow's pure, pop blast of martial arts action, giddy physical comedy and sheer movie love bursts off the screen."
0, Seems to have been made to appeal to viewers who believe that a prestigious painting is infinitely more important than a mere movie that celebrates the exalted existence of this painting.
0," Like a beautifully wrapped gift that fails to impress once the box is opened, Memoirs of a Geisha is gorgeous to look at - - but that's about it."
0, A beautiful bore: Robin has daddy issues and Ridley Scott pushes income redistribution
0," The sun'll come out in The Day After Tomorrow, but first you have to slog through almost two hours of bad plot and wooden characters, intermittently punctuated by some spectacular depictions of bad-weather catastrophes."
0," Whatever [Shyamalan's] intent, he has at least succeeded in producing a film that, in its wild hodgepodge of absurd emotion, hammy jokes and jumping creeps, is unlike anything else you're likely to see."
0," From its flash-forward framing sequence to its glossy black and white images, the film emulates Raging Bull in nearly every particular, while failing to capture even a sliver of that tortured-soul sports-movie's insight or visceral power."
0," A film that could have wryly dealt with matters of race, or simply could have been funnier, had it possessed a clearer template than a star pairing and a truncated title."
1," While it's overlong and sometimes disjointed, this heist flick delivers genuinely likable characters, winning performances and solid laughs."
0, Whatever wit could be mined from the idea of breaking the code to baby talk was exhausted in the original Baby Geniuses five years ago.
1," If Wendy and Lucy isn't the most dynamic movie around, at least its tone and approach are sure-footed and appropriate."
1," Speaking as someone not of Crumb's generation, the film doesn't transcend the typical documentary formula."
0," Competently made, the film doesn't really bring anything truly original to the table other than Purefoy's turn as Mr. Washington. "
1," ""Star Trek Beyond"" is a perfect combo of blockbuster Summer movie and a tribute to fans of the source material that will live long and prosper."
0, Aiyaary is sketchily-written and not compelling. It tests patience even if you are a fan of the genre.
0," When it comes to Thomas himself, despite Jones's spirited performance, the film doesn't succeed in bottling lightning. There are flashes of the poet's genius amid the boozy windbaggery, but the demons that drove him remain elusive."
0, What is our reward for the collective effort of this prestigious assembly? One of the most dreadfully unnecessary movies in recent memory.
0, You know what happens next. Tomb raiders gonna tomb raid!
1," For a film that dwells in the past, Gerwig avoids banal sentimentality, instead offering us something excitingly present and ephemeral."
0," Justice League is no magic carpet ride, no matter how hard it strives for multi-superhero awesomeness."
1," In this handsomely made psychological thriller, a troubled couple tries to move on after the loss of their young daughter, but find themselves mired in the past."
1," Left to her own devices, Gerwig has arrived and solidified her place as one of the most invigorating, observant and authentic voices in movies today with a director's acumen to match."
1," Stacked up against Taxi Driver and Raging Bull, sure ... this is lesser Scorsese. And 'lesser' Scorsese is still better than almost anything else around."
1, You will want to bathe in hand sanitizer for a week after seeing Contagion. 
0," The resolution of the film's dilemma is not only absurd and unbelievable, but is further humiliating to the two actresses."
0," Everything in this movie is convenient... she just finds whatever she needs, it's like a videogame."
0," The shortcuts are maddening, but so is Spread as a whole. Just because the lead character is an insipid, mean-spirited waste of time doesn't mean the movie has to follow suit."
1, Michael B. Jordan gives a hell of a performance. Maybe people will stop blaming him for FF and give him his due. Killmonger is one of the best characters Marvel has ever created. Stop using the Race card to promote this film.
1," In Tulip Fever it's the financial story that's fascinating, while the romantic angle for the couple is a little tired. "
1, Performed with subtlety and offering no pat resolutions
1," Renï¿½ï¿½e Zellweger pulls this picture out of the potential story mire, handsomely assisted by Kinnear, Morgan and Rock, taking us on a wild and funny ride in the backseat of her fant"
0, A lot of the picture veers uneasily between solemnity and slapstick and 47 different genres.
1," Fascinating, suspenseful, illuminating, and ultimately moving."
0," There's not much style here, beyond the uniformly good acting, and even less of a point."
1," Witness For The Prosecution has the pace and patience of live theater, but not the look. Wilder doesn't get overly flashy with camera moves and angles, but he does shift positioning subtly and effectively."
0," A rambling, tedious, seemingly unending mess that can't be salvaged by three decent but mostly underwhelming performances. Maybe some Benzedrine would make the whole experience seem worthwhile."
1, Entertaining enough silliness. 
1," The skill with which Eli Roth has constructed his film, especially its first 40 minutes, leads me to give it the benefit of the doubt. It's creepy, gripping, horrifying stuff."
1," I did not laugh much, but it is effective on an emotional level, as a portrait of a people trying to cope with gang violence that is spinning out of control in their community."
0," For a film that tries to be a smarter, more cerebral, romantic comedy-drama, Feast of Love sure does a lot of dumb things."
1," Lady Vengeance dazzles us with cinematic savoir-faire, but it is ultimately as cold, calculating and contradictory as its anti-heroine."
0," Any humor was bound to be a case of diminishing returns since the more you see of this bear, the less shocking it becomes."
0, Collins has a gamine-like quality reminiscent of a young Audrey Hepburn but her effervescent charm isn't enough to hide the chronic absurdities in the storyline.
0," There's quirky, and then there's straight-up annoying."
1," Without meaning to disrespect the die-hard Tolkien fan who views this as overproduced heresy, those looking for a fab romp need look no further than this middle-earth mania."
0," No fish flop, but neither does it make a discernable flash."
0," We should be leaving the theater in awe of what was accomplished, but the movie feels too by-the-books and unfortunately does not leave a lasting impression."
1," Although the two halves of the The Children Act don't coalesce as they should, Thompson gracefully keeps the whole from falling apart."
0," Too much of The Limits Of Control feels canned and airless, so stifled by Jarmusch's obsessions that it loses all sense of surprise."
1, This beautiful and continually surprising film makes us think about what children can and can't bear.
1," When we say it's like nothing else you've seen, you've really got to take our word for it."
0, Funny only in your dreams!
1, remarkably straightforward but appropriately quirky
1, Was Capote an altruistic artist or a fame-whore? You decide. A brilliant debut from Bennett Miller.
1, A layered documentary that is as much an inquiry into the nature of time and memory as it is an individual's diary.
0, Relentlessly colorful and cute.
0," A tiresome movie that is at turns grim, overly violent and patently absurd."
1," Rob Stewart literally gave his life for Sharkwater Extinction. From the beginning, you see his passion for sharks and his dedication to saving them."
0," Though you'll probably leave the theatre swinging to the music, this highly conventional movie really doesn't do its subject justice."
0," Fails to deliver an emotional impact, and that's mainly due to its schizophrenic nature. The results are a movie as disjointed as its title makes it sound."
1," A life-affirming, emotionally captivating and rewarding experience. It treats the audience like sophisticated, mature adults---a demographic that has been sorely neglected by Hollywood nowadays."
1, A suspenseful and somber tale of Holocaust heroism. 
0," A comedy with charm, but it won't lose anything on the small screen."
1," ""King Arthur: The Legend of the Sword"" will not become a fantastic movie classic, but at least it's an entertaining movie to see once. [Full review in Spanish]"
0," Long thought to be impervious to everything except Kryptonite, the Man of Steel ultimately falls victim to another, even more insidious force: a frustrating, hit-and-miss screenplay."
0," While a fish rots from its head down, a film suffers from the screenplay up -- which is where Sherlock Homes stinks."
0, The clever notion of presenting high school life with the artificiality of a high school play isn't compelling in practice.
0, It functions primarily as a reminder that Cuba Gooding Jr. is still alive and touting for work.
0," Time-travel films often bring up a lot of questions, and they often fall apart with thoughtful scrutiny, but that's part of the fun. However, one shouldn't be wondering that the only benefit these two have with this magical mailbox connection is that they"
0," 'T2 Trainspotting' is a movie reeking of desperation, made by a director going through a malaise, looking for a spark to reignite his creative juices."
0, The setup is ripe for a black comedy but the movie never fully embraces the darkness and the level of humor is on par with the limp skits for which Wiig is responsible on Saturday Night Live.
1," The second-to-last movie pitfalls strike, but the series has earned enough good faith to make Part 1 essential viewing. "
0," With so many people hanging around, you'd think Marshall and screenwriter Katherine Fugate could scare up an interesting plotline or two, but no such luck."
0," The script weaves three interlocking stories in unlikely ways and relies on random acts of violence, fate and God for dramatic complications that the characters aren't fleshed-out enough to whip up on their own."
0," The off-kiltered Tim Burton version of Alice in Wonderland might frightened younger children, confuse older ones and bore the adults."
0," Beauty and the Beast is one of the great, traditional love stories and this film simply feels devoid of any such romanticism, with no chemistry or spark between our protagonists of any kind."
1," 'Gimme Shelter' is not a concert film but a statement of a sea change, of the group way back when and of an end to its and the public's innocence and to the counterculture that once flourished. "
1, The 3-D adds a vertiginous thrill to a chase on flying tables and a touch of claustrophobia to a maze of underground corridors.
0," Better than the first one, but that's only taking into consideration that it couldn't possibly have been any worse."
0," At times, the sad sights are enough to make a person hope the put-upon guy finds success. The problem is, as affable as Giovanni is, there's not much more to him."
0, The General's Daughter is an overheated thriller populated by actors who far outclass the material.
0," Welcome to 2010, Freddy Krueger. You were scarier in 1984."
1," It isn't without significant flaws, but overall an effective and memorable fantasy spectacle."
1," A serviceable drama/thriller that starts a little slow, but ultimately gets into a nice rhythm."
0, ...and the obvious takes it's inevitable course. Yadda yadda yadda.
1, Wholesome and uplifting in the classic carpe diem manner and Harris is a lot more attractive than Robin Williams.
1, Tomboy has a restrained style that results in something very touching and beautiful.
0," Tonally wonky, comedically creaky and confuses light-as-a-soufflï¿½ï¿½ with just plain si"
0," Yet for every witty line or cool cameo there's a most Apatowian artificiality, especially considering he's cast his actual family members in these sometimes unflattering roles. This Is what? Some kind of cruel therapy?"
1," Its sepia-tinted bones are weathered, but spit-shined real nice, sporting an all-star cast and a gold mine of studio production value."
1," Cedar Rapids is both hilarious and heartfelt. It's also powered by a dream cast, led by the outstanding Ed Helms."
1," I sort of liked the 2006 film, and I sort of like this one, too. I may like it a little more, because Dujardin grows on you."
0, This latest unnecessary remake of a minor horror flick lacks even the benefit of novelty.
0, This likable indie comedy fails to completely get off the ground.
1, The strange action plays out with a dreamlike lucidity reminiscent of late Luis Buï¿½ï¿½uel... It's also dreamlike in its handling of time; the film takes place over a few years but feels as if it transpires over a few d
0," A flopping mess, a hammy hodgepodge of crude jokes, awkward slapstick gags and sometimes mean-spirited, vulgar humor that just isn't funny."
1, RZA's obvious and infectious affection for the genre carries the film past its equally obvious rough spots. 
1," Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a fine time, but it won't exactly sweep you up into New York City's wizarding world."
0," It sounds like a sitcom plot, but ""I Do,"" if you pardon the expression, plays it entirely straight. The drama covers predictable ground. "
0," A grandiose, inflated, FX sledgehammer."
1, The Gospel According to Andrï¿½ï¿½ is the most essential fashion documentary since Bill Cunningham New York in 2
0, A frustrating film that abandons the promise of intrigue for something ultimately quite ordinary.
0," ""Third Person"" staggers well over the two-hour mark only to self-destruct in a burst of overwrought cleverness."
0, A wheezy and utterly incompetent attempt to further extend the life of a franchise that was already running on fumes back when Ronald Reagan was still a first-term president. 
1," You will endure much pain and suffering on the screen, yet there is rare power in this story of survival, a glimmer of hope when it feels like all has been lost."
0," Like the rambling speech that opens Dom Hemingway, Richard Shepard's initially amusing, genre-less piece of filmmaking tragically expends its virtues thin by about the 30-minute mark."
1," Perhaps it was unnecessary, but there are moments of great art in Faster, teasing that perhaps George Tillman Jr. may one day make a great film."
1," Another deliriously silly stop-motion animation delight from Aardman, filled with giddy pleasures and witty details. "
0," The performers have little to do besides spill and drink blood in this tedious, inconsequential B picture. The sun doesnï¿½ï¿½(TM)t rise nearly fast eno"
1, An incredibly entertaining and satisfying action flick well worth the wait to finally see these two martial arts masters work together.
0, Race follows the pattern of so many other sports biopics in which it's white patronage that makes black triumphs possible.
1," It's almost too much to hope for: a summer blockbuster that's compelling, original, well-crafted and perfectly cast. Yet that is precisely what director and co-writer Christopher Nolan has given us in 'The Dark Knight Rises'."
0," It's diverting if you don't mind the pretense, or if you believe everything you see at the movies."
1," A sour, wicked film that neither looks nor feels like the rest of the busy sub-genre."
1," Even seemingly ordinary scenes of girlfriends bonding - ironing hair, wearing jeans in the bathtub to shrink them, hitchhiking - are fraught with the sense of the external forces that will divide them."
0, It's a good effort. Just not an entirely successful one.
1," Maudie is a slow, earnest film that pleasantly subverts the narrow-minded hagiography we expect from the story of an artist."
0," The problem with awkward, indecisive, ordinary people is that they're dull to watch - and Sophie Brooks' low-key rom-com hits all the boring buttons."
0," Of all the would-be Potter projects that have hit the screen over the years, this is one of more polished and enjoyable ones."
0," From junky production values to the parade of unfunny supporting characters to its lazy energy, ""Dumb and Dumber To"" falls on its face."
1, Dante's third unqualified masterpiece. A freeform outburst of satire and mayhem that stays true to the spirit of the old time Warner Brothers Looney Tunes.
1," But after an uneven start, it's also so outrageous, so fast-paced and so much fun that you'll likely not be too bothered by the excessive style."
1," 96-minutes to shut off the serious day-to-day world machinations (Iran deal, anyone?) and get a story that, heck, I like. "
1," If you succumb to these charms, I guarantee walking out of the theatre into the noisy city will be a jarring sensory overload experience."
1," this film is a harrowing experience, but also one that is jubilantly uplifting in its celebration of quiet courage and the strength of personal belief"
1," Broadway legend Elaine Stritch is the subject of the documentary ""Elaine Stritch: Shoot Me"" and, quite a bit of the time, she also tries to direct it."
0, Is this a movie or a feature-length advertisement for Qwest? We're not just talking one product placement; this brand name is nearly omnipresent.
1, The acting is so naturalistic and the various subplots are so well balanced that the confused piety of the characters gradually begins to feel like anyone else's everyday problems.
0," Recalling one of those exploitation flicks so popular in 70s drive-ins, everyone involved deserves a pat on the back for producing such a fearless British movie. If only it was better."
0, I spent most of the running time wishing I was home watching Deadwood or Justified instead.
1, An enormously entertaining pop-culture ride.
0," A chunky clunky history lesson, Viceroy's House leaves you feeling as if you've been kept back after school for something you did not do."
0, Despite its initial blandness it does evolve in something quite touching.
1," The truths ""The Green Prince"" reveals about family, friendship, and betrayal don't only matter on the West Bank and its artistry will live on even if peace between Israel and Hamas is eventually accomplished."
0," As Robin might have said of this semi-boondoggle: ""Holy overkill!"""
1, [A] throwback ... driven by the immense talent of its lead performers ... thoughtful and funny and heartbreaking; a hell of a compelling and emotionally engaging story.
0," As a pure Perry apologist, this critic found Boo 2! boring, frankly."
1," If you were to take From Paris with Love seriously, it'd be easy to be offended...Fortunately, it's nigh-impossible to take the movie seriously, so just enjoy the destruction."
0," Racist fantasy is never a good start for a children's film, or any film, for that matter."
0," It cannot be said that any member of this trio is the most gifted conversationalist known to man. In fact, once pleasantries are out of the way, they barely have anything of note to say to one another."
0," As a remake it is not trying to achieve anything close to the original, but we are watching it for the same reason Burt is doing it: insufficient options."
1," Richard Lester's inventive, humorous mockumentary of the Beatles had a huge impact, forever changing the definition and limits of the musical movie genre."
1," John Cassavetes was one of those rare artists of whom it could be said that his flaws were his strengths, and his strengths were his flaws...Consequently, the film has to rank somewhere between the two in the Cassavetes canon, and I'd opt for putting it c"

1, Provides an entertainingly accessible introduction into the world of the Bollywood musical.
0," ""Monster Hunt"" broke box office records in China, but American viewers may wonder why this confused and confusing adventure-comedy enthralled audiences there."
1," There's a touch of Gracie Allen in Frances, an indomitable blithe spirit who lives happily within a bubble-world of her own construction."
1," a treasure, and more thrilling and suspenseful than most big action movies"
0," It boasts four comedy stars at the top of their game and a director 1 from revolutionising contemporary comedy, but this reboot of one of the biggest hits in the comedy fantasy arena is uninspired, bland and lame-brained."
1," The cast is so good, they elevate and expand the movie."
1, There's nothing like a well-placed nod to the classics to help elevate a dumb summer comedy.
0," It's just a matter of time before Neeson's killing sprees no longer slay audiences. He may look for them, but I'm pretty certain he won't find them."
1," Cï¿½ï¿½line Sciamma's girl-gang movie is a disarming affair, a long way removed from the macho posturing of other French films set in the Banlieue, such as La Ha"
1," All this is tribute to how Schamus both respects the text, its narrative thrust and its thematic undercurrents, while allowing it to breathe and open up before us."
0, a sad passing for a once-pioneering series
0," The story collapses in the second half of this initially promising mess and it appears that, even after 1,935 years, the tragedy of Pompeii is still too soon to trivialize."
1," McDonagh's characters may be awful, or simply lost, but they're all addicted to the art of the tall tale and the dark allure of the nightmarish bedtime story."
1, Gavron is blessed with a talented cast that's fully invested in the project. Duff and Carter transform what could be cliched roles while Gleeson and Whishaw make the men more than one-dimensional villians.
1," ""Tomorrowland"" is a globe-trotting, time-traveling caper whose giddy visual whimsies and exuberant cartoon violence are undermined by a coy mystery that stretches as long as the line for ""Space Mountain"" on a hot summer day."
1," The acting is uneven, but the film almost captures how Mapplethorpe was a visionary artist and openly gay man at just the right moment in history."
0," There are sharply observed moments of social intercourse and a nice current of realistic honesty. But when I ask myself what it is that these women in the movie want, I come up with bubkes."
0, The one perfect aspect of Jennifer's Body is its title: No one is going to like this movie for its brain.
0," Kids aren't scary. Get rid of them, though, and Sinister 2 might be."
0," A violent B-movie bamboozler that, while fun for a spell, is finally unconvincing."
0, McDermott looks uninterested in the whole affair.
1," Dick Pope's digital cinematography, akin to the canvases themselves, is luminous, magisterial and expressive of all that Turner's rebuffs and grunts do not bother to express. "
0," ""The Boss'' provides the talented Melissa McCarthy plenty of scenery to comically chew on - she is very funny at times - but the story is paper-thin, and the script gives much of the supporting cast the proverbial pink slip."
1, PRINCE AVALANCHE feels uniquely like David Gordon Green and I for one am thankful for that.
0," Efron and Devine start out very strong as an anything-for-laughs pairing, but like the movie itself, their connections grows progressively weaker throughout."
1," A hell of a good time for those willing to settle into its easygoing vibe, especially during its climactic, impeccably choreographed showcase, which sent me home with a big, goofy grim plastered on my face."
1," Even when the film is horrible to look at, it's beautiful, a strange and grim portrait of an annihilating American frontier."
1, The equivalent of a fun summer read. What more can you ask for in a film like this? 
0," A film that confuses silence with great insight, beautiful imagery with emotion and the empty with the profound."
0," The film is smart, literary, nuanced, slightly stagy - and pedigreed to within an inch of its life. It practically reeks of dusty, yellowed pages and engraved-leather bookbinding."
0, The trouble with computer graphics in films these days is that a computer doesn't have half the imagination of a human.
1," It's only real downfall is its lack of ambition to be more than decent. Saldanha has also been unerringly safe in most of his story telling choices, with little unexpected character development and quite a bit of overly tidy moralizing."
1," What the film does well is to immerse us in the tragic weirdness of wartime logic, where nothing works as we would expect. It's a strong, engaging film about how hard it is to wage peace."
1," Creative, cute and crammed with an array of fun, recognizable characters"
0," An inert lead performance from Mantas Janciauskas gives the impression not of a man plunging into the very heart of darkness, but of a student who's made a very bad decision about how to spend his gap year."
1, The film is at least packed with solidly written and played moments that encourage the audience to laugh at how serious everything seems when we're teens.
1," It aims to entertain, to offer a few tame chuckles for parents and children to enjoy in a purely Saturday-morning way. And it accomplishes that."
1, Miller's many fans are likely to hail this as a masterpiece. Rarely has an artist in one medium been so loyally served by another.
1," It's hard to believe that Melville's 1969 masterpiece--one of the most accurate chronicles of the French Resistance--never got released in the US until 2006; Splendidly acted, this film draws on the helmer's own experience."
0, This low-rent -- and even lower-wit -- rip-off of the Farrelly brothers' oeuvre gets way too mushy -- and in a relatively short amount of time.
0," A medieval genre goof of impressive physical scale and disproportionately modest comic ambitions, as an entertainment animal, Your Highness is disappointing where it counts."
0, [Plays] more like a distended awards show package than a proper documentary ...
1, The film is one of the few capable of allowing its watchers to shed a tear and laugh within more or less the same sequence.
0, Like something out of an illustrated book for children who have never heard of Suu Kyi. Sophisticated it is not.
1," A cautionary tale of celebrity culture and the ruinous power of the media, and a gentle reminder that society really should look after people like Winehouse as cultural treasures, rather than tear them down for the sake of tomorrow's tabloid headlines."
0," Fired Up is a desperate and vacuous attempt at a teen comedy that not only lacks laughs, but even the gross-out moments and shameless nudity used by other such genre offerings."
1, A relentlessly-cheesy B-flick far funnier than it is frightening.
1," Despite its shortcomings, including a predictable plot twist, ""Faster"" isn't the turkey you might expect it to be."
1," Gleefully subverting the standard good vs evil hokum, while delivering an eye-popping adventure with characters you can really root for, Megamind is simply super."
0," Twelve is not only the new Eleven, it's also the new Ishtar."
1, Telstar is still an oddly compulsive story of an exuberant mess of a man who played a key role in British pop history.
0," It's a wallow in bad male behavior and the women broken by it, capped with a ludicrous climax...Star Emily Blunt gives it her all, hurt, woozy and hysterical, but it's not enough to keep this train on the tracks."
1," Lucas' trilogy earned its place in eternity not for its mechanical precision, but for its intangible qualities of inspiration and wonder."
0," Devil's Path doesn't have the delicious double twist of What Keeps You Alive, and in terms of pacing it does take a little too much time to get to where the audience would like it to be as a bonafide shocker"
0," It's clear the filmmakers weren't sure where they wanted their story to go, and even more clear that they lack the skills to get us to this undetermined destination."
0," The film goes out of its way to present a Romeo and Juliet tale from a different angle, but the mixing of romantic melodrama and mythic gothic is disappointing. "
1," It aims for the middle and hits it, which should not be an achievement, but in the dire landscape of middling studio comedies, it unquestionably does better than most."
0, The movie somehow manages to be both trite and macabre.
1, End of Watch was a surprise. I liked it a lot. 
0," Why, given unfettered access to such an inventive, imaginative, iconoclastic performer would you take such scant opportunity to actually show her performing, live?"
1," Despite the save- the-earth memo, this is very much a Stephen Chow-directed work and that means ludicrous situations and nonsensical jokes."
1," It's worth seeing for Affleck's charismatic performance and for its vision of America as a land of greed, violence and political expediency that some moviegoers will find all too familiar."
1, A movie of visuals first and foremost.
0, A disappointing follow-up to Jet Li's Romeo Must Die.
1," From references to past 007 movies to unexpected twists and top-grade action, Mendes' movie feels like a well-wrapped birthday gift for Bond fans."
0, This directorial debut from music video show-off Higuchinsky is all flash.
0," Generic, messy, flat, over-extended and all-too-earnest, running for nearly two hours with sentiment and silliness where its scant narrative should be"

0," At, say, 85 minutes, this would have been a jolly little swashbuckler, but at 143 it turns into an unholy trial."
1," Carion has given it exactly the qualities that often appeal most strongly to moviemakers and humanists: social breadth, warmth, humor, sympathetic characters and a passionate sense of justice."
1, The most emotionally resonant and fulfilling Transformers since the feature series first rolled out in 2007.
1, This moment of women rising up and taking control of their own empowerment is the perfect time to release a documentary about Hedy Lamarr. 
0, Ultimately this movie is better forgotten.
0," Tired ""old guys hit the road"" motorcycle road trip dramedy. "
0," Like any diagnosis, things here can go one of two ways and -- considering the presence of its acting titans -- it's not a stretch to hope the film would traffic in truth, profundity or the slightest ounce of soulfulness."
1," We return to this scene at the end of the documentary. By then, we know a lot more about these local bands, and how much music means to the kids, and how they even inspire each other."
1," This time, the freaks carry the film, and you get the distinct feeling that's the way it was always meant to be."
1, [A] sheen of familiarity is undercut by Stishova and screenwriter Alisa Khmelnitskaya's intelligent interweaving of some traditional narrative tropes with an examination of Kyrgyz folklore
1," Capitalism's slickness, and its illusion of cumulative coherence, is actually a product of Moore's signature bait and switch, the same lack of structural integrity that mars most of his films."
1," The issues may be simply put, but the brilliant action sequences engage us viscerally."
0, Excruciating and horrendous...
0," Emmerich can say what he likes, but I would rather go read whomever wrote the great folio."
1, An average movie blessed with an amazing performance. 
0, What's meant to be a live-action South Park just winds up in a scatological dead end.
0," Harbinger Down brings the monstrous goods as expect, yet struggles to tell a coherent story that's worth the practical effects success."
0," Why not cast a Thandie Newton, a Kerry Washington, even a Halle Berry in the lead, unless one actress happens to be sleeping with the producer?"
1," A rarely cheery but carefully crafted look at flawed and all-too human behaviour, worth seeing for Michelle Williams and Ryan Gosling's sincere, intelligent performances."
1, Jennifer Garner delivers a standout performance in this uplifting and heartfelt drama.
0," Despite its cynical viewpoint on the state of politics in India, Newton is primarily a goofy comedy which never really rises above the level of 'amusing'."
0," A snooze, despite all the sex and other gunplay."
1," A scorching entertainment set amid harsh, icy conditions."
0," If a robot... is the most charismatic character, something is wrong. [Full review in Spanish]"
0, Touch Me Not proves that you can reveal a lot of the body while revealing very little of the self.
1," Ridiculous, artless, and wildly entertaining, Dangerous Men is more than the sum of its fascinatingly misguided parts, although it will take a special sort of moviegoer to truly appreciate (or endure, depending on your perspective) its charms."
0, This biopic seemed about as amorphous as a junkie high.

0," Wanting to appeal to a broad audience %u2014 especially young teens %u2014 is more than fine. It's admirable. But soulful, philosophical 13-year-olds do exist. They do! And they can even handle a religious discussion with lots of words involved."
1," I laughed out loud once, yet I am giving this film a positive review. There's something magical about a G-rated film that attempts to capture life, death and a little bit of magic."
1," Bill Gunn and Ishmael Reed collapse conventional notions of reality, providing simultaneous glimpses into the minds of dozens of characters, lingering on scenes and informing them with confessional intensity."
0," It's a mystery with no solution, only a handful of clues and a smoking gun."
1," [Rules Don't Apply] is winsome, lighthearted fun with some light social commentary. It's a re1ing night out."
0," It's fitting that the star of ""Misery"" is here for the torture that follows."
0," It's unfortunate that Enter the Void is so fundamentally idiotic, its unholy combination of Tibetan Buddhism and crude melodrama becoming maddeningly repetitive and turgid."
1," It's an admirable effort and a lot of fun. I only wish it weren't trying quite so hard, or that by trying so hard it doesn't still manage to undermine its own lesson."
0, Fans of straight action/adventure may enjoy this film; fans of TV's Mission: Impossible may not recognize it.
1," Schumer and Hawn make a great team, their comic chops meshing nicely (a sequel looks all but assured)."
1, What's really so appealing about the characters is their resemblance to everyday children.
0, It's so aggressive you don't even have to like it; the movie likes itself well enough for the both of you.
1," I was licking my movie critic chops anticipating a juicy negative review of what surely would be a disastrous take on another ghost-story-turned-romance. Surprise, surprise!"
0," A one-trick pony, or should I say one-trick goat, which relies heavily on slight variations of a running joke which gets stale pretty fast."
1," The movie is uneven, largely because it's trying something unusual and ambitious. But that unusual ambition also makes it deeply moving."
0, A visually attractive but curiously flat retelling of the old chestnut.
1, Stuart Little offers a neat package of warm-hearted charm and sly wit.
0," Hamlet 2 star Steve Coogan told HollywoodChicago.com: ""It did make me nervous to play Jesus. I wondered whether the director was just trying to be provocative to annoy Christians or if it was just funny."""
1, A film that shows a clearly broken city by social inequality showing how money is able to immerse humans in a system of commodification. [Full review in Spanish
1," While not without anecdotal punching power, the film nonetheless seems like a relic since it unfolds in a vacuum, willfully ignorant or silent on any of the factors influencing events on the ground."
1," If you like Scorsese, or if you just like thrillers, you'll have a good time."
0," The title has the ring of prophecy. Although the film frustrates viewers with a cliffhanger ending, it's hard to believe a second 'Airbender' will materialize out of what is likely to be the indifferent reception to this wan hand-me-down."
1, Frequently plays as though Daniels conceived it as a mash-up of Toni Morrison's The Bluest Eye and Rob Marshall's Chicago... Finally and semi-subversively denies that 'everything is a gift of the universe.'
0," Some nice moments, but it doesn't seriously - or funnily - engage with the idea of religion."
0," Ultimately, the film is not frightening enough to keep you up at night, nor ingenious enough to make you wonder about the twist - and not even bad enough to make it good."
1, Poetry is another sobering philosophical work by Lee Chang-dong.
0," Fascinating at certain moments, especially when Lewis is exploring his character's grief and bitterness, it still feels like a work in progress."
1," For all Lonergan's storytelling skills, Manchester by the Sea stands or falls on its central performance. Casey Affleck, outstandingly skilful at keeping his cards close to his chest, packs immense power into a study of incurable grief and guilt."
0," There is simply no way to get or stay involved in a movie when the main character has more physical forms than Count Dracula, especially when most of the amateur actors assuming the role cannot act at all."
1," Nothing less than a masterpiece of art and integrity, capturing with vast magnitude the grandeur, majesty, and surreal whimsy of Tolkien's mythical Middle-Earth."
1, A low budget and moments of unintentional camp can't derail Bond's irresistbly cool debut.

0," Apatow can't relinquish his love of random animal comedy enough to let his dramatic sensibilities really take hold, and as a result the film is torn, trading laughs for winces and vice-versa in a way that feels conflicted, rather than organic"
1, Smith blurs the lines of traditional thoughts and storytelling techniques to create a throught-provoking and intriguing montage of love.

0," manages to expand the candidates' relatively petty, self-made moral dilemmas into a broader discussion of the ethics of triage, but viewers will find themselves tested by much bickering, brawling and shrill overacting to get there."
0," Exactly the worst case scenario of what pops into your head when you hear the phrase ""movie directed by a fashion designer and gay icon""."
1," It's a period piece with an eye firmly fixated on the present, and the re1ing nature of Westmoreland's approach is deeply appreciated and significant."
0, I'll Be Home For Christmas is entertainment for the whole family only if your whole family is incredibly bored.
0," More aphoristic than explorative, Solitary Man takes for granted the audience's interest in mapping a star's reckoning with his persona onto a sensational but shallow script."
0, The movie version of a card player who doesn't know how to quit when she's ahead.
1," A sci-fi action movie that wears its influences loudly, what Total Recall lacks in originality it makes up in its brooding tech-world action noir spectacle."
1," It's not by accident that Ingrid is thrust at us with no real back story and no explanation for her behavior. Ingrid may be a blank slate, but aren't we all the minute we click that ""Create a New Account"" button on a social media app?"
1, Hittman's drama is empathetic (but not necessarily sympathetic) and profoundly sad at watching Frankie's inability to reconcile his two worlds.
1," Not for all tastes, Repo! The Genetic Opera can boast a lot of imagination and some evident talent."
0," Unfortunately, Provost mostly avoids Leduc's substantial literary contribution in favor of depicting her life solely through her friends and mentors, and her mother Berthe with whom she had a dysfunctional relationship."
0, Just because it's visually appealing doesn't mean that you will fall in love with it.
1," A lively, well-acted, deeply honest look at love, family and romance. "
0," A boring film that fails to transcend from its basic idea, remaining as a story without too much tell about that small group, and how it affects their work to their respective personal lives. [Full review in Spanish]"
0, An oddly limited film.
0," Hardy's an exceptional actor, and LaBeouf has a certain fizzy charisma, but they each twang embarrassingly every time they have a sentence or two to utter, and not even in a way that matches."

0, Relies on double entendres so obvious they wouldn't get a chuckle from Beavis and Butt-head.
0, The ensuing cycle of miscommunication is endless and trying.
1," This taut drama exists in a timeless noir territory, a world of free-floating dread and dashed hopes where mood supersedes specifics of time and place."
0, Absorbing without being particularly illuminating.
1, As much bittersweet as inspirational.
0," Glum, degrading and dull exploitation film featuring Jim Carrey as ""the last honest cop in Poland."" "
1, Book Club is the kind of story that strives to give viewers a good time and that's exactly what it does. [Full review in Spanish] 
1, Tucker is so inventive he makes it worth seeing.
1," The Nice Guys never lives up to the promise of its hilarious first 10 minutes, but Crowe and Gosling are good enough to leave you hoping for a sequel."
1, A terrifically smart film that precariously balances sophisticated laughs and inspired visual slapstick.
1," As the speechmaker and his speech teacher, Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush elevate each other's game to the stratosphere and beyond."
0," The latest offering from Shane Meadows has, like most of his others, received enormous critical acclaim; and once again, I don't know what he has done to deserve it."
0, This is a sequel that's even less necessary than Monsters University; often times it feels like the movie can't even justify it's own existence while you're watching it. 
1, Gyllenhaal is outstanding in this inspiring warts-and-all story of a Boston bombing survivor's recovery battle.
0," Yawn; real fannish obsession can be much more absurd, and unsettlingly fascinating, than this burlesque ever gets."
0," People in Hollywood should never work with children or animals, W.C. Fields once said. Maybe that should be expanded to hyper-realistic computer-generated children and reindeer, too."
0," It's nice to watch a comedy that doesn't screech or foul the nest, but ""The Big Year"" is no big deal."
1, This is one hell of a fascinating ride.
0," There are no laughs from the material, which wants to be edgy but can't go for broke because it's too busy being a trifling piece of holiday cheer but without the cheer."
1," It's a film guaranteed to appeal to tender-hearted pet lovers. But the movie, which was largely filmed in Miami and Fort Lauderdale, turns out to be less about dogs than it is about one man's trajectory through adulthood."
0," On Stranger Tides is arrgh-uably the best franchise sequel yet. Faint praise, to be sure."
0, The problem may be that The Fault in Our Stars is based on a book by John Green; this certainly wouldn't be the first time a strong literary narrative had troubles translating to the screen.
0," What makes this one different? Absolutely nothing. (Sure, it's based on a true story, but I mean come on, whatever.)"
0, Intriguing differences from the original don't so much improve on it as suggest that Lee and the screenwriter never figured out why that first film worked. 
1," It's no match for The Evil Dead, but as far as tongue-in-bloody-cheek gorefests go, this update of the H.P. Lovecraft tale is a lot of fun, and it easily earns its cult status."
0," Except for the CGI variety, there's no magic whatever to be found in this grim fractured fairy tale that cribs pretty shamelessly from previous smashes-'Frozen' in particular-without making good use of the pilfering. "
0," We Are Your Friends has an undeniably nice beat, but it never hits the magic tempo that is so vital in getting everyone to euphorically groove. "
1," It's done very well indeed. I think Jack Black is wonderful. I thought that the whole progression of the film was, to me, unexpected."
0, Bring your earplugs because this ungodly mess is as painfully loud as it is mind-numbingly stupid.
0, What's missing here is the reason anyone would want to watch a film about Capote: his writing talent.
0," When the climactic chase has kicked into high gear, there's a striking scene of orchestra players performing on white platforms over what appears to be a pool of blood; the whole movie is like that, a combination of high culture and cheese. "
1, At last: they're upgraded to the starring roles they deserved all along.
0," A Mr. Collins of a movie: fatuous, self-important, and nowhere near as smart or as elegant as it thinks it is. There isn't a lick of wit to be found here."

1, A slickly crafted throwback.
1, The King's Speech is the kind of production that makes you ask: why can't every film be made this way?
0," [It] aims to set itself squarely in the fictional canon of Chucky and its brethren, but it ends up trying to do so much that it forgets to scare us."
1," You wouldn't surf past ""Say Anything"" to find it, but ""Art"" is a decent-enough entry in an overcrowded genre."
1, Everything you've come to expect from a Disney film.
0, Comes off more like a series of episodes than a balanced narrative.
1, A little Gallic charm goes a long way in this engaging romantic comedy.
0," Director Robert Zemeckis hits a new artistic low with Welcome to Marwen, a film that mistakes schmaltz for substance and employs downright boring novelty animation in a hackneyed attempt to stir the emotions."

0," Most of the film is good enough that way: dumb, but not boring."

0, It's all so hyperactively paced and so frenetically animated I can't say the film as a whole left me satisfied.
1," You can feel Scorsese's exhilaration in every moment, of The Departed, and the experience is an adrenaline rush, pure and simple."

1, I have no experience with the source material or any Agatha Christie works in general... but from someone who had no horses in the race? I enjoyed it far more than I thought I would.
0," Seems to take pride in being as loud, obnoxious and moronic as humanly possible."
0, One of those dark and plodding serial killer flicks that feels like it has come plodding out of 1995. 
0, Director X...can't seem to differentiate between the strip-club aesthetics of a rap video and the demands of a full-length feature film. 
0, Prisoners is an overblown missing-children mystery that wants to comment on the dysfunctional soul of America.
0," Not that anything's inherently wrong with a patriotic war movie, but there's a distastefulness in the film's simpleton view of mass suffering."
0," The story is surprisingly unfocused and, when it snaps out of the protracted setup phase, it plunges into quasi-thriller territory that relies on a series of hard-to-swallow contrivances."
0," Mother! is a riot of religious symbolism, of-the-moment socio-political valences, and references that attempts to unite themes from nearly all of Darren Aronofsky's work."
1," This is a story of longings, obsession, and the inability to move on from events unaccounted for by justice. "

0, The film's horrifying experience looms over each well-constructed frame without anywhere to go...
1," It may sound bleak but there's a captivating warmth, humour and vigour to this heartfelt passion project. That's because Rupert Everett not only lives and breathes Wilde but also his world."
0," A gift-box filming of former gymnastics star Dan Millman's uplift book, Peaceful Warrior stars appealing Scott Mechlowicz (like a more ripped Tony Perkins) as Millman, finding his way to glory after a drastic injury."
1," Powerful sound design effectively accentuates the sense of stormy isolation, giving the mountain the last word."
1," It's dangerous to call something an instant classic, but sometimes it's simply the truth."
0," The filmmakers clearly wanted to avoid the politics surrounding the first Gulf War even as they pay tribute to the Marines, the jarheads, who went to Saudi Arabia to fight. But the result is a movie rife with ambivalence."
1," The theme of innocent love is so prevalent and it feels good to watch unconditional displays of it, even within an animated fictional film."
1, Naturally works with Bryan Cranston portraying the real-life historical figure; he's not only an amazing actor but in many ways looks and sounds like the real Dalton Trumbo
1, ...could have worked as a bracing reminder that superheroes don't exist and that their movies can't save us - if only it had taken the implicit themes of the novel further.
1," Roeg, often using a dazzling technical skill, jettisons narrative in favour of thematic juxtapositions, working best when exploring the clichï¿½ï¿½s of social and cultural rit"
1," It's a very conventional, Bible-bashing approach to religion and spirituality, with dialogue that feels simplistic and preachy. Plot holes abound, as does an OTT soundtrack. It does have a heart, though, in part thanks to Washington."
0, ...almost a humorless parody of Roger Corman at his worst...
1, What saves this movie is Gordon-Levitt's subtle and profound performance as a political conservative being torn apart by his ingrained loyalty to his country and his moral convictions about the bad things that he's doing.
0," Admirable effort, but the movie aims for the heartstrings so resolutely that it ultimately leaves much less of an emotional impact than it should."

1," This isn't some inside joke, it's a universal lesson learnt... even if that lesson is expertly disguised by a brilliantly bizarre and truly bonkers story set in the 'burbs."
0," The production seems genuinely fearful of turning this effort into anything more than a dewy tale of deliverance, with a side portion of hunks. "
1, A cheery collage of anecdotes about how popular culture brings people together and inspires them to fight for the things they love.
0, How in the name of sweet Jesus did first-time director Kinka Usher get such a first-rate cast to act in this muck?
1, Jones is exemplary in her ability to nail down Ginsburg's spunk and toughness. 
1," It stands up just fine to Temple of Doom and Last Crusade, and it does not stand up to Raiders, and this is all that a sane person would have ever hoped for."
1, A really innovative way to explore a potentially boring subject like economics in a way that mass audiences can understand and appreciate.
1," It's a great story, brimming with Cold War intrigue and historical context. In other words, a fastball right down the middle for Steven Spielberg, the Ken Burns of theatrical history lessons. "
0," This movie suffers from idiotic dialogue, ridiculous situations, and unbelievable characterizations throughout."
0," It's proficiently put together but decidedly derivative, right down to the Usual Suspects-esque twist ending."
1, It seems to be Blake's name as much as anything that propels the character deep into a strange frontier where Blakean ideals of innocence and integrity have been obliterated by ignorance and cruelty. 
0," After waiting so long, the strongest fragrance on display is one of sweat and mediocrity."

0, A relentless immersion in combat strikingly realized but none too pleasurable to sit through.
0," That's right, the race for Worst Picture of the Year looks like a lock."
0," Fun as the film occasionally was, those involved would have done well to take the advice from another 80's action classic: ""You're too old for this &$#&!"""
1, It's hard to imagine any but the most hardened grouch being able to walk away from the effort without a smile.
1," Stylishly mounted, well paced, with clever use of flashbacks, and written with panache."
0," Seasoned actors are left to yell pointlessly at one another, while Beth and the zombie angle slowly decompose."
1, Mirren and Sutherland make this a film that's impossible to write off.
0," Raising and educating middle-class African-American boys is seen first-hand, cinema veritï¿½ï¿½ style, over 9 years in fitful, occasionally insightful, and intimately reveal"
0," Ask ten people who've seen this movie what the title's ""miracle"" is referring to, and you'll get a couple of different guesses and a whole lot of blank stares and shrugs."
1," The stories told ... are very compelling, interesting and often moving, but they do not and cannot explain the religious belief that those persecuted still want comfort from even as they challenge its dictums."
1, A biographical tale that captures more than just the story.
0," Tomb Raider is an action adventure movie that is almost okay, but it runs out of steam long before it gets to the time to raid tombs. "
1," Drive's rambling, at times confused narrative is electrified every so often by the kind of intense performance that even the Scorsese-directed Robert De Niro would be proud, courtesy of Gosling."
0, It's no Thunderheart.
1," ""Samsara"" is a magical and lyrical film that lingers on its beautiful (and, sometimes, not-so-beautiful) imagery of places that few will ever get to see - save for here."
0," Director Peter Berg mounts a special-effects extravaganza that's very boring indeed, and doesn't quite deafen us to the inadequacies of the script, while Smith pretends to be a grumpy git but, naturally, winds up begging us to love him."
1," Though Ifans has the splashier role, Craig, last seen in Michell's previous film, 2003's equally provocative The Mother, is outstanding as a man whose philosophy cannot be reconciled with his feelings."
1," With good management of that personal will called ""suspension of disbelief"", The Girl in the Spider's Web is an enjoyable action film and, so, we can value the prized work of [director] Fede Alvarez. [Full review in Spanish]"
1," Mildly entertaining with great production values, exhilarating musical numbers, and a lively supporting cast, but it lacks the heart and soul of the classic 1991 animated version. "
1," When a forty-four-year-old man makes a movie about his family and friends sitting around singing old tunes, you certainly don't expect an unforgettable amalgam of humor and heartbreak. But that is precisely what Terence Davies delivers."
1," Niccol has framed his story in a world of dimly-lit interiors in soft browns and creams, devoid of human warmth but decorated with carefully-placed and exquisitely-curated artefacts."
1," There are a few good pop-culture gags here, but it is the strong central performances of [Samara] Weaving as the hottie and Lewis as the nerd that elevate this to more than just an exercise in ironic B movie-making."
1," Even Daryl Hall would have to admit this is one of the finest animated features committed to film, produced and packaged during Walt Disney's ballsiest years of control."
0, It's pretty sad that Sandler's sunk so far that a movie being merely bad is somehow a success. 
1," There's not much narration here, and little is needed in the true, self-propelled tale of a 13-year-old girl named Aisholpan Nurgaiv, who learns the traditionally male skill of hunting with the aid of eagles."
1," [Hello Destroyer] is constructed sturdily enough to stand up to any forthcoming scrutiny, and maybe also built to last in a way that most feature debuts simply are not."
1," Cynical bike riders may well snicker at scenes of car-lovers behaving like tree-huggers, but Paine effectively builds the viewer's affection for EV1, so the removal of the cars works as the film's climactic moment."
1," The songs aren't exactly the catchiest, its message of tolerance far from new, but it sure is lively while it lasts."
1," Far too gory for any but the very strongest of stomachs, this is nonetheless intelligent and well constructed horror fare."
0," Nearing the end of his career, Woody Allen has become a hit-or-miss director with considerably more misses."
0," Shoulda been big fun, but a deadly combination of no script and a strange lack of sexiness renders this male-stripper tale an aimless, although very commercially calculated, bore."
1, Here is a film that wholly embraces the concepts of the unknown and the uncertain.
0," The actresses make this dull, male-centric story more watchable."
0," Roger Ebert put it best, ""Doom is like some kid came over and is using your computer and won't let you play."""
1," There is one thing that power can't stand, and that is to be mocked: The social importance of this topical romp should not be underestimated."
1, A great impressionistic piece about an actor's fantasy becoming their reality. Director Hopkins really makes an exciting leap of faith.
1," There's a fine line separating complex from convoluted, and -- with limited time to tell le Carre's sprawling tale -- Alfredson often comes down on the wrong side. "
0," While it is based in a kernel of a potentially compelling idea, Magic Mike feels rushed, unplanned and-pardon-half-assed."
0, How long can you keep the whole tribute thing going and still make it feel 1? How much send up is too much?
0," The idea of a guy trying to buy his way into heaven is good, but this movie doesn't take it anywhere other than the usual set of world saving scenarios."
0, Ricki and the Flash proves to slack in the crowd-pleasing entertainment this exciting triumvirate is slumming for.
1, A successful disaster movie about the tragic events of April 2010 where Wahlberg is amazing. [Full review in Spanish]
0, High concept meets lightweight substance in writer/director Andrew Niccol's clinical cartoon rendition of a not-too-distant-future dystopia. 
1," In 2017, Chapter 2 is a triumphant return for cinema's coolest action anti-hero."
1," The unstoppable director Richard Linklater (A Scanner Darkly) and writer Eric Schlosser take the latter's nonfiction bestseller and rig up a fictitious, sprawling narrative to take up the book's scathing talking points."
1," Superb. The ""Goodfellas"" of figure skating."
0," Gimmicky love story that's not saved by its bittersweet ending. Acting is more than just cooing with your eyes. It seemed like 500 days allright. Paul Chambers, CNN."
0, This drama about a deadbeat father trying to straighten up for his young son takes an unusual and not particularly convincing turn when it's revealed that dad has a superpower.
0," By any objective accounting, Thirteen Ghosts is exactly a baker's dozen too many -- this is a zero of a film."
0," There are certainly worse ideas out there for movie comedies than My Super Ex-Girlfriend. (The Wayans brothers hit Little Man, for example.) However, there aren't many ideas that are more poorly executed than this one."
0," It remains watchable to the very end, mostly thanks to a stolid cast that absolutely refuses to be sucked into the muddied tropes that make up the screenplay."
0, Our Brand Is Crisis is like a third-party candidate who enters a race in the final weeks. Any good qualities just don't get exposed and the candidate gets lost in the pack no matter how much manipulation is happening.
1," One of the year's pleasant surprises, an offbeat lyrical fable about the coming of age of a painfully shy guy, splendidly played by Gosling; it's shocking to realize that this gentle dramedy is helmed by Gillespie, who helmed the dreadful Mr. Woodcock."
1," Thing is, it all actually happened."
0," An essentially simple tale of love across the class divide grows too diffuse and distracted to stir the heart, while its two parallel stories ... never coalesce into a satisfactory mythic dialogue."
0," There's not enough of the familiar, beloved Alice in Wonderland characters nor is there much humor or fun."
0, A sincere effort but it all feels entirely predictable and underwhelming.
0," Sure, this is comic book stuff, but that doesn't mean that the actors should be saddled with wooden dialog and two-dimensional characters."
0, One of the dullest films of the sextet thus far.
0," The plot is an afterthought, the performances given with a wink and a clip-emptying flourish."
0," an experience in collective embarrassment %u2014 embarrassment for yourself, your fellow audience and the actors onscreen forced to take part in the movie's wildly inept, bottom-of-the-barrel shenanigans."
1," There is a lot to admire as the film embraces a pleasing brand of old-school chills over modern-day, pop-culture hipness."
0," Ultimately, the film amounts to little more than a consummate study of suspense technique, all dressed up with nowhere to go."
1," Ransom is tautly directed by Ron Howard, who's a very good director. It's far from his best film, but he nicely shows us the psychological collapse of a flawed entrepeneur."
1," 8 1/2 is probably the most potent movie about film-making, within which fantasy and reality are mixed without obfuscation, and there's a tough argument that belies Fellini's usual felicitous flaccidity."
0, Hollywood has good reasons to continually make action movies aimed directly at teenagers. Every bad reason can be summed up in one viewing of I Am Number Four.
1," Personal but self-indulgent, poignant but also lethargic, Apatow's third comedy is his most serious and original but also his most problematic work to date."
1," A worthy, if unadventurous biopic of the recently departed South African political icon."
0, We're left with a protagonist repeatedly shooting herself in the foot for no halfway sympathetic reason.
0," Leap Day occurs once every four years. Awful romantic comedies like Leap Year, unfortunately, are far more common."
1," Even if you can't remember a line after you've seen it, the images remain with you a long time."
0, This is what happens when filmmakers throw everything against a wall and see what sticks. A lot of it doesn't stick.
1," this movie is easier to admire than to like... Allen as a director is still getting better, but as a screenwriter he needs to do a few more drafts."
0, Rarely has a movie had a more appropriate title.
0," There are bad movies, there are terrible, misguided mistakes and there are unbearable and embarrassing ordeals. The Producers: The Movie Musical is all of those."
0," Gilliam's imagination rubbing up against his constricted budget, and CGI showmanship is not on any level his forte. You miss the hand-made charm and extravagant matte-work of Brazil, even Baron Munchausen."
1," ""Despicable Me 3"" is unwieldy, but it mostly works, as co-directors Pierre Coffin (who also voices the Minions) and Kyle Balda never lose sight of the film's emotional center, packing the rest with as much humor as they can manage."
1, Hancock suggests new visual directions and emotional tonalities for pop. It's by far the most enjoyable big movie of the summer.
1," Yes, there's some real top-level allegory going on here, but it's not necessary that you unravel all the layers to enjoy the movie."
0," ...maladroit dans sa tentative d'allier rires et frissons, insatisfaisant sur tous les plans..."
0," At nearly two hours, Ghost Rider is a little long for a guilty pleasure."
0, The great Audrey Plaza is let down by weak material in this mirthless female-centric gross-out comedy.
1, Boden and Fleck are attentive to detail and the nuances of social interaction -- in the cornfields of Middle America as well as in the Dominican Republic. And Sugar is a thorny but endearing hero.
0, Cruise's witty banter is crowded out by special-effects overkill.
0, Best enjoyed by those with short memories and a longing for needless excess.
1," Von Trier seems content to broach ideas rather than explore them and, consequently, his movie is technically accomplished and teasing rather than intellectually provocative."
0," It's not like every biography needs to be a takedown, but in this case it misses something significantly deeper. Part of why Gordon is so interesting is because he's a bit of a good guy gone bad, or at least living in a dark world."
0," Kal Ho Naa Ho is filled with these ridiculously convenient plots twists, obviously manipulative emotional moments and problematic gender politics"
0," Technically a motion picture, Around the Bend is essentially an advertisement for Kentucky Fried Chicken. It also happens to be mind-numbingly cloying."
1," A quartet of Thai directors offer a dystopian vision of their nation, steeped in a mood of collective paralysis."
1," As a youth, perhaps no other film opened my eyes to the wonderful possibilities of cinema as much as The Seventh Seal."
1, Your mileage may vary but I've got to appreciate Wonder Park's ambition. 
1," My King is a reminder that even stories of the grandest, most exuberant aspects of life sometimes find truth in the smallest of details."
0, Pah to logic and believability!
0," There's a rich narrative to be mined from this historical moment. Until that movie gets made, however, we've got Randall Miller's pandering take."
0," Bad timing is the central theme of this Four Weddings and A Funeral wanna-be, which despite several weddings, a funeral and a clichï¿½ï¿½ ridden script, groans with predictable twists and turns as the two protagonists um and err about their future toge"
0," Lauded as a witty moral fable with a revelatory performance from its star, this romantic comedy is in fact meretricious, manipulative and reactionary."
1, You never quite grasp just how bad most comedies are until you see one as good as Hot Fuzz.
0," Morgan and Cornish are both short-changed as ballsy cops who harbour painful secrets, while Farrell remains largely off screen until the anticlimactic, mind-bending final showdown."
1, The Revenant is proof that cinema can stop being just art and becomes an experience. [Full review in Spanish]
0, It slows down remarkably whenever Isaac's married med student or Bale's crusading journalist start going ga-ga over an Armenian beauty played by Charlotte Le Bon.
0," As factory-assembled rom-coms go, No Strings Attached isn't as dire as last year's Killers (also starring Kutcher) or 2009's Bride Wars. "
1," the tale of an unlikely friendship, one that reaches across generational and cultural barriers"
0," It was as if I opened a puzzle only to find that the majority of the items within the box didn't belong. How do you get a lint covered gummy bear, a harmonica, three bullets, and a corner puzzle piece to fit together? You don't."
1, Creates a vivid sense of what it's like to be on the remote fringes of a great state experiment.
1, A modern take on a classic tale that serves as an enjoyable saturday morning flick. A lovely movie. [Full review in Spanish].
1," First and foremost, Ip Man is an excuse for Yen to demonstrate his newfound mastery of the Wing Chun style. On that front, the film succeeds brilliantly."
0," There's no meat in Jon Avnet's generic cop thriller, not even the pleasure of Pacino's ham."
1," Journey 2: The Mysterious Island offers much visual spectacle yet falls flat in every other way, making this a lost adventure movie not worth seeking at the multiplexes."
0, Why is the dialogue so muffled and clipped that it's hard to understand? Why didn't Mr. Jordan spend more time grounding his self-enchanted script in some semblance of reality?
1," I think it was a mistake to have Christian Bale play Bateman quite as goofy as he does, but it's a terrific performance within its boundaries."
1," Each of the three couples has a different approach to solving the mystery, so it's funny to see them try to outsmart each other even though we know they're all mistaken."
0," A throwaway piece of pop ephemera, like a '90s Casino Royale, momentarily arresting and soon forgotten."
0, Trusting an action drone like Worthington to anchor the human drama is a fatal mistake.
0," There is plenty of amazement here, to be sure, but all too little in the way of grace."
1, Touching - the right kind of movie to show in school.
1, The film has a personal tone that is not always detectable in his other movies. It enhances a film that's one of the most thoughtful in Schroeder's body of work.
0," Robert Redford teams with The American Film Company for The Conspirator, a project better left to the History Channel than the big screen."
1," The setup is commonplace, but the scenery is delicious, the dialogue re1ingly tart and the keen supporting cast frisky or affecting, as the occasion demands."
1, Maiden simultaneously functions as a timeless ode to passion and a reflective account of a fascinating highpoint in the history of women's involvement in the sports industry.
0, It's basically a cheap thrill. An expensive cheap thrill.
0, Wears out its welcome within minutes.
0," The inevitable absurdities and coincidences of the plot are easy enough to accept along the way, except perhaps for the sex club, which is just a little too absurd to function as a plot device."
0, When Tiffany is not around [Nobody's Fool] falls into the same formula...it doesn't really resonate. The writing was kind of weak. 
1," To put it simply,Bird Box is a heart attack. I mean that in a good way."
0," So, is this merely an extreme teenage version of The Hangover, or is it another sign of the end of civilization as we know it?"
1," It's both preposterous and horrific, and therein lies its powerful, disquieting charm."
1, Richly compelling and disturbing.
1, It's awfully funny.
0, This comically tasteless and flavorless adaptation of Ayn Rand's bombastic magnum opus delivers her simplistic nostrums with smug self-satisfaction.
0, the appeal of the movie so disintegrates with every second of resolution that I found myself hating it by the ending credits
0," Restless may have a few things working in its favor, but the balance tips toward quaint self-indulgence, teenage narcissism and amateur storytelling. "
1," Excellent message, excellent carnage. Two great tastes that taste great together."
0," Staple of newspapers since 1954, leaving the producers over 50 years of canine antics to help build a screenplay. So, naturally, they invent a series of urine and fart jokes to best service the enduring legacy of the rascally Great Dane."
1," Those going looking for frights will be rewarded with something more substantial: an experience rich with atmosphere and humanity, and drama ultimately more enlightening than the cheap thrills that pervade the dime-a-dozen ghost stories we've seen before."
1," A beautiful, affecting documentary with an appropriately sweet original sound track."
0," This, throughout, never feels like true Farhadi."
1, Things to Come is a quiet and reflective piece worth a contemplative look.
0," LXG isn't DOA, but it's sending an SOS."
0," For the majority of people, the name Jack Durant will be unfamiliar. Sadly, after Travis Mills' film Durant's Never Closes that will likely remain the case."
1, Apollo 13 is a blast for thrill-seekers and a joy for humanists who seek emotional truths in films.
1," An electrifying coming-of-age story set against a backdrop of crime, poverty and immigration."
0," This lavish coffee-table-book of a movie gradually reveals itself as an uninvolving, crashing bore."
0," For every movie based on a clever screenplay that takes years to get made, there are a dozen like the formula hostage thriller Firewall."
1," I can't think of a better film to be watching in 2017 than Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. Underneath its cynicism, the film is ultimately hopeful. "
1," Wonderfully complex but warmly human, Bergman's drama is one of his very best."
1," There's much to like in this story of a group of young movie-makers who stumble upon an event right out of, well, the movies."
1, The story of a gruelling trek through sub-zero temperatures that is both visually stunning and dramatically chilly.
0," A franchise that's run its course, the satire feels limp and the anger muted."
1, Hairspray more than fulfills that most basic (but not easy) task of the movie musical: It leaves audiences frugging their way down the aisle.
0, At least there are enough laughs to help you forget about the film's lack of structure or substance.
0," The worst fault visually, probably intended as a charm against the spell of low-budget-itis, is relentless darkness. Pervasive shadows in most shots do not evoke atmosphere, but eye strain."
0, Danny Boyle's useless recovery on of one of his greatest successes. [Full review in Spanish]
0," Amazingly, it is even worse than it looks."
1," The Informant! is an inspired social satire, a near-perfect single-carat diamond in an age of mindless movie bling. It's a small movie, but not in any sense minor."
1," An authentic depiction of depression, mental illness, and a poetic meditation on mankind's relationship with the universe."
1," A brilliant, thought-provoking documentary."
0, A project over-designed yet under-thought.
0," ""Martha Marcy May Marlene"" isn't much of a movie, but it's a great introduction."
0," It's messy, misguided, and occasionally obnoxious, trying to be heartfelt and hilarious, which is a tonal balance that requires a more inventive director."
0," Disappointing thriller that's let down by a tedious script, a frankly ridiculous final act and some dodgy overacting by Kevin Spacey."
0," Anyone who might want characters and not cliches, compelling dialogue and an intriguing scenario, look elsewhere."
1," From the first scene of ""Krisha,"" writer and director Trey Edward Shults puts us off balance, and for the next 83 minutes keeps us that way, almost daring us to look away."
1," Wassup Rockers evokes some of Clark's fetishistic quirks. But you get the feeling that this time around, he's giving his appealing core cast of amateur actors more room to be human."
0," Red, also known as Red Riding Hood, is back, but this time she's voiced by Weinstein Co. ""It Girl"" Hayden Panettiere (""Scream 4""), instead of the presumably more expensive Anne Hathaway."
0, Emmerich and Devlin's 'Godzilla' turns out to be almost as overblown as the 1977 revision of 'King Kong.' The only thing that might send you screaming from the theater is the horrifying Puff Daddy song heard over the end credits.
1," If you think that theatre has nothing to do with your cinephilic tendencies, Office is easy proof that the masters of cinema tend to borrow from the stage, to often exquisite effect."
0," How long can you watch a handsome face with all the expressiveness of a rock? That question will haunt you as you sit through John Abraham's new action thriller, Rocky Handsome."
1," The film is a whopper of a tale, one designed for Oscar nominations, Best Picture and Best Director among them."
0," Cringe-inducing, uneven, juvenile, overlong and painfully unfunny. It's a witless blend of crudeness, rudeness and lewdness which sets a new low for American comedy. "
0," In this numbingly ludicrous science-fiction drama, written and directed by Alex Garland, a talented cast of actors play undeveloped characters delivering leaden dialogue in a haphazard story that's filmed with a bland slickness."
1," ''Don Jon'' is a lark, but an enjoyable one with a full-hearted finale, and it further reveals the considerable talents of Gordon-Levitt."
0," While animation can be a good tool to help kids - and adults - explore such topics, ""Smallfoot"" still seems a bit too heavy-handed for its own good."
0, Rosenthal (Halloween II) seems to have forgotten everything he ever knew about generating suspense.
1," Like many French products, it's quirky but not all it's cracked up to be."
1, Pierre Niney is outstanding as Saint Laurent.
1," Directed by Hugh Wilson, this cheerful comedy is aimed at 5-10 year-olds, who will thoroughly enjoy it."
1," It is a bruising war story from a filmmaker whose primitive storytelling insists on conveying as graphically as possible the hell of physical suffering in wartime caused by those supposedly ""human."""
1," If you are drawn to stories that are high on aesthetics with lyrical narratives, Mirzya is a portrait that deserves a long look."
0," Depp's Wonka exudes none of the gravity required for the role. It's as though he didn't take the role seriously. Rather than an intimidating candyman teaching brats a lesson, this Wonka is simply a freak."
1," What really matters is the affectionate, humanist perspective from which the filmmaker dramatizes the plight of a man who simply can't bare the weight of his job."
0," If your under thirty and get the references you might think this is a heck of a lot of fun, but if you haven't a clue as to who Brittany Spears is, forget it."
1," ... touches on exceptionalism but detours into a clever critique on a society reliant upon rescuers... worth our wait, even it feels a bit overstuffed. After fifteen years: still incredible."
0," There's no real behavior, just endless movement brought off with empty crackerjack skill."
0," The problem of Stewart's performance is indicative of Assayas's broader weaknesses as a director. In ""Personal Shopper,"" his subject is intimacy and sensuality, but the film offers neither."
0, I laughed a total of three times during this witless trudge as it went through its predetermined part-two paces and found myself wishing I was re-watching A Bad Moms Christmas.
0," It's like we're stuck in stasis, the constant repetition of actions lowering the stakes they once possessed until their culmination loses all impact."
0," Margot has no sense of balance, or nuance, or even mitigating psychological weight."
0, The Iceman is like a gangster's cold locker: all the nutritive items have been taken out to make room for the dead bodies.
0," Thought-provoking snippets and moments of suspense surface, but for the most part the film is generic."
0," Lo que podrï¿½ï¿½a haber sido una original road movie en tren termina diluyï¿½ï¿½ndose en una experiencia caprichosa, carente de humor y sensibilidad, y finalmente algo ir"
0," This acceptably diverting superhero outing keeps threatening to break free and become something special, but in the end, there's just too much at stake. And that's a shame, especially for Paul Rudd fans."
1," The sci-fi thriller not only subverts expectations in brilliant ways, it explores deeply felt themes of life, loss and love. In other words, it's light-years away from Independence Day 3. "
1, May be the best movie about the breakup of a family since Shoot the Moon.
0," The Black Dahlia looks so terrific and is filled with so many imaginatively showy sequences and masterful directorial touches that you almost don't notice that, in every other way, it's just not a very good movie."
0," The Little Death is just a mostly laughless tour of unlikeable, depressive suburbanites."
0," ... the real cursed are ticket buyers expecting a scary ride, which they won't get."
1," Jobs creates a powerful narrative in Steve Jobs' life and conveys the profound value of innovation, including the cost of such a drive."
0," Mommy culture, with its capacity for smugness and solipsism, seems like a ripe topic for parody, but Baby Mama approaches it with kid gloves."
1, Sean Price Williams' videography is so lovely -- and the film so meditatively paced -- that even the questionable becomes seductive.
0," The plot isn't really more than a situation, with a few vaguely condescended-to characters who shuffle about wide-eyed and open-mouthed."
1," Remains one of cinema's glorious enigmas, endlessly compelling and intriguing."
1, Max Payne is a junkyard dog of a film that is true to its video-game roots even as it transcends them.
1," Out to give voice to every disparate shred of the Long Tall Texan's legacy, All the Way ends up a fascinating story undermined by its own compromises."
0," ...so dependent on plot contrivances and so altogether preposterous, it seems an unfortunate waste of Pacino's and Farrell's acting talents."
0," Good luck with yourself, Greenberg. But I think I want to break up."
0," Bay can be a master of exuberant chaos, but here the violence mostly lands with a sickening thud, which is fitting, one supposes, but also ultimately numbing."
0," Ms. Williams tries her best, and sometimes that's almost enough."
0, The result is compellingly bonkers.
0," Director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo's technical skills are impressive, but this psychological chiller loses traction in the over-explanatory concluding stretch."
1," I can't support or defend Doomsday in the slightest. But it's also the most fun I've had at the movies in weeks. If you're in the mood for sheer sensation without the slightest bit of intelligence, this is the flick for you."
0," It's an odd, if somewhat original, way of playing with sequel conventions: the plot exists in a reality where the original film also exists. But outside of knowing winks, this is cookie cutter carnage."
1," The look and feel of this historic battle is perfect for the virtual backgrounds and obscene violence. Again, trust me on the violence."
0, Money Monster is a well-directed and well-acted dramatic thriller weighed down by heavy-handed social commentary and implausible plot beats.
0, I haven't been this disappointed by a film since the new Indiana Jones.
1," It's like a thief you see from a mile away, who telegraphs his or her every move, and still steals your wallet. "
1," It's truly hilarious, and utterly adorable."
0, Despite good work done by some of the cast this post-apocalyptic cannibal tale wanders in the desert for far too long. 
1," [An] erratic, but enjoyable goof from the Judd Apatow hit-making machine."
1, Saturday Night Live is almost too much for one documentary: every topic director Bao Nguyen bounces off seems to merit its own show ...
1," It's impossible to watch ""Wonder Wheel"" without letting Allen himself and the current response to Harvey Weinstein not color the (absolutely gorgeous) viewing experience."
0," In the end, like virtually every other remake that has been released recently, it's polished and predictable."
1, [Chronicle]'s approach delivers a 1 take on superhero genre and its attitude should appeal to its YouTube generation target audience.
0," King is good enough that you can't help but root for her. But frankly, I can't imagine paying full ticket price plus concessions for that privilege."
0," There's nothing wrong with a squishy, sentimental romantic confection now and then. But Letters to Juliet is a mere lollipop. It's gone before its 101-minute running time expires, and you're left with the stick."
0," Unless you're a devotee of the art of puppetry or mildly funny sex jokes, you can probably just let this one slide."
0," The movie's never a chore to watch. But neither does it engage us the way this kind of story should, by pulling us into the hero's mania and getting us to feel what he feels."
0," We already had one Other Boleyn Girl this year, but even as the occasional blip of droll humor breaks up the monotony and 'tell me something I don't know' developments, it's still quite a dullard's affair."
0," Essentially an overly long endurance test, and it wears us out by the end."
1," It's a mess, but it's a commendable mess. Bonus points for ambition and nerve."
1," ""U2 in 3D"" doesn't just give you the feeling of being at a rock concert. It gives you the feeling of being a rock star."
1," It does have Sparks-ian themes of love and loss and it has a gooey layer of Hollywood candy topping, but it is a bit sharper and less sudsy than Sparks movies."
1," Diferente em ambientaï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½o, tom, textura e ritmo, ï¿½ï¿½ um western que sï¿½ï¿½ Altman poderia realizar, concentrando-se na humanidade de seus personagens e suas ambigï¿½ï¿½idades de maneira tocante, profunda e poï¿½ï¿½tica sem jamais nos de"
1," Whilst there are a few hiccups in the film, it's still engaging and engaging enough to look past the cracks."
1, the most fascinating business story I have ever seen on film.

1," Candy-colored Thor: Ragnarok is a retro, dimension-hopping hoot."
1," Kinetic revenge yarn with wrinkles drive-in movie critic Joe Bob Briggs might appreciate, like martial arts moves at point blank bullet range; what he'd call gun fu. There's also car fu, knife fu & beagle fu but the less said about that, the better."
1," A more responsible and less 'entertaining"" film than [Moore's] past work."
1," This franchise ends with a fitting finale that neither proves the series worth, nor does it disappoint the faithful."
1," When Harry Met Sally is a beautiful, brainy, touching and lilting romantic comedy that should touch the heartstrings of lovers and those yearning to be in love everywhere."
1," ...for now, as the song says, let the good times roll."

1," February or not, Frozen already has a reserved spot as one of the year's best pictures."
1, Watching The Karate Kid's franchise reboot is a little like running into your old crush at a middle-school reunion: Warmly familiar and yet altered enough to warrant a second look.
0," Murray completists -- I count myself among them -- will flock to it, but will probably come away disappointed at how not-weird this oddball film actually is."

1," ""The third remake of this decades-old Hollywood tale has a lot on its mind about art and fame in the modern age. Yet it also crafts an old-fashioned, touchingly tragic love story."""
1," Though at times Teutonically tough-going, Fritz Lang's German expressionist masterwork exerted a profound influence on art design and the science-fiction genre..."
0," It is all so enigmatic and underwritten I felt rather shut out. A 'challenging' film is one thing, but one that actually slams the door in your face is quite another, as well as rude."
1," While 'Minions' may lack a lot of the heartwarming depth of its predecessors, this goofy little movie is still a whole lot of fun."
0," Essentially, Chuck & Larry is an oafish chance for audiences to laugh at gay-bashing jokes and then feel morally redeemed for doing so."
0," It's one of those films where the characters always seem to be Behaving, as if ordinary life has to be jacked up into eccentricity."
0," Red 2 seems stifled by the weight of its own detailed exposition, and only Hopkins seems to be enjoying himself in the same gleeful way that Mirren did in the previous film."
1, Kids who love Barney or the Muppets will undoubtedly feel right at home.
0, Explores a common ground for noir thrillers before stumbling and imploding in a climax that feels like it might have been hijacked from an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie.
0, One is forced to suppress actual groans.
0," In short, the movie feels, if not exactly glamorous, then simultaneously overly processed and overwrought, even when it's wallowing in the most abased behavior."
1, A penetrating look at a fallen hero in the context of race and police brutality in Los Angeles and the country as a whole.
1," Made with a combination of sincerity and technical skill that is effective on a fundamental level, even if it never quite becomes the devastating emotional experience that it clearly wants to be."
0," A big, dumb mountain of fluff that boggles the mind with its sheer volume and range of foolishness."
0," The Dickens elements elevate Ghosts of Girlfriends Past above the level of pure formula; unfortunately, the presence of McConaughey in full sleaze mode makes it difficult to like this film's Scrooge, even after his redemption occurs."
0," Feeling like a very laboured version of The Hangover, Get Him To The Greek is a bitter pill to swallow in comparison."
1, M:I-2 ultimately delivers the goods and is certain to be a huge hit.
1," Freeman's performance is a fine tribute to Mandela, perfectly capturing his grin, posture and unbreakable upbeatness."
1, This film is a terrific and welcome break from the loud and noisy films of the typical summer blockbuster.
0, Dark Shadows really is just a mixed bag of chuckles and drama that never really gets the balance quite right. 
1," Ida is barely 80 minutes and lacks fullness, and the style that's so arresting can also seem studied. But the movie's chill is hard to shake off."
1," A satisfactory but slightly poky romp, saved by marvelous, expressive animation that generates a crisp, colorful feel for the world Belgian artist Herge created so very long ago."
1," The film's final showdown may be stylised and as ludicrous as they come, but by then we've become caught up in Barney Thompson's endearing, exaggerated lunacy."
1," In its own way, it's a movie with plenty of imagination, but the gory progress from fight to fight to fight is monotonous, and the running time is quite demanding for those of us stuck with finite lifespans."
0," Doesn't come across as the story of a man whose work many would adore long after his death, but the story of a kid who just happened to let his guitar strumming drown out his own whine."
1," Outstanding, cool-headed documentary. "
1," The Coens concoct brilliantly clever ways of intersecting the lives and stories of the characters during the course of this goofy, entertaining dark comedy."
0," Just more of the same, with the cast aggressively trying to sell the ""reality"" of this found-footage picture, which only reinforces its obvious artificiality...flattens the initial burst of surprise into irksome retread."
1, Dark and mesmerizing.
0," The intentions are admirable, but the movie is only so-so."
1, It's worth the price of admission to see Norton and De Niro sparring across a prison-house desk.
1, taut and suspenseful in interweaving the fundamental pleasures of a good mystery with an astute critique of the current sociopolitical climate

1, This is Stephen Fingleton's first feature: we can't wait to see where he goes from here. 
0," This movie's relationship to teen-romance--flirting with it, undercutting it, swooning back into its clichï¿½ï¿½d thrall--is frustrating and intriguing in spurts. By the end, it's more like it's-a-wrap than the messy, crumpled-up drafts of l"

0," Rahim remains a magnetic leading man, but original insights into fame, family and ethnic identity are few and far between."
0, That it escaped the straight-to-video bin suggests that Hollywood's contempt for today's youth audience has reached a new level.
0, Much of the film is below even Bruckheimer's usual popcorn-munching standards.
1," The familiar beats of the crime saga ... are all present and correct. But the dark political and societal subtext makes for a new, discombobulating sensation."
1," Portman gives a great performance as Fania, but as the director she seems worried about letting the character take over the movie."
0," A macho foodie fantasy with Cooper as a swaggering sex god in an apron. If this were a comedy, it would be brilliant."
1," Fans of Ridley Scott's landmark 1982 dystopian noir drama Blade Runner will be thrilled to find that director Denis Villeneuve has soaked his follow-up, Blade Runner 2049, in as much grime-and-neon atmosphere as the original."
1," Excess leads to excitement, and exhilaration, and entertainment."
1, It occurs to me that the pace and tone of the comedy is actually pretty sophisticated -- perhaps too much so for its supposed intended audience.
0," A clumsily written, surprisingly foolish and misdirected adaptation."
1, It's inspiring what encourages staying the course and working to uphold one's beliefs.
1, This adaptation of Jane Austen's novel is a brilliant film about female manipulation. [Full review in Spanish]
1," Writer/director James Gray uses the strengths of his top-notch actors to transform ""We Own the Night"" into something more than a standard-issue cop tale."

1, We're never given any reason to feel. Perhaps that's why you care more for the inanimate 911 Carrera -- praying it will never crash -- than you do the horndog lovebirds occupying its two front seats. 
1," A singular, captivating experience."
1, A full awareness that it's kind of a cheap melodrama (one of the characters even says so) doesn't change the fact that it is but the young Miyazaki's visual palette is notably beautiful and the voice work is strong throughout.
0, [The Discovery] is an earnest search for meaning that ends up not revealing much at all.
1," Intense, astonishing sci-fi thriller has real soul."
1," Wes Anderson's and Owen Wilson's wild, wooly, and wonderful follow-up to their surprise 1998 hit ""Rushmore."""
1," All in all, fun viewing for kids."

0," Overflowing with bad filmmaking, acting and a hackneyed script teaming with forced humor and inane behavior."
1," ...an unholy insane mess of a movie. Yes, it is self-referential and self-aggrandizing in that peculiar self-deprecating way the writer-director has perfected. "
1," Much like the new Jordans that drive the plot, Tipping wants to show off his stuff, and a lot of what he has in the trunk is pretty great."

1, Keke Palmer has single-handedly saved another feel-good drama from drowning in sap.
1," Tip-top performances, led by young British thesp Jamie Bell, and a deftly handled tone reflecting all the title teen's confused emotions make Hallam Foe a viewing delight."
1," The tone of this droll, thrillingly odd animated film isn't easy to describe...A tad dark for little kids, this one-of-a-kind movie delivers 80 minutes of idiosyncratic inspiration."
1," It is a docudrama done with great sensitivity, and with unerring judgment in the writing and in the depiction of the passengers and hijackers."
0," This flick is like a cheap thriller where the wisecracks always fall flat and the author couldn't be bothered to invent a new plot, so he just patches together some old ones."
1, The twistiest thriller since Memento.
0," It would be impossible to detail in this space all the ways Roland Emmerich's latest action/adventure, White House Down, violates the bounds of good (or even moderate) taste. "

1," Fincher is perfectly suited to the material, with its voluminous clues to be organized and parsed, its emotional austerity, and its serial murder, rape, and sundry sick plot twists."
1, This Irish-Canadian drama tells the true story of Maud Lewis (played beautifully by Sally Hawkins).
1, Super 8 takes its place among the best B-grade science fiction movies of this generation by copying the best of the past 50 years.
0," The ending is as inevitable as it is sentimental, with more than a hint of austere ""good taste"". For French cinema, it seems like business as usual."
0, A bold but clumsy attempt to bring Langston Hughes' popular musical to life onscreen.
0," House of Sand and Fog doesn't deliver on the gut level of contest, and neither does it offer any other terms in which it does deliver for the audience."
1," A rich, organic and transparent work. [Full Review in Spanish] "
0," slow, heavy-handed and stiff-jointed, prone to admiring the scenery and populating it with bits and pieces plucked from a smorgasbord of post-apocalyptic interplanetary reality-bending cuisine."
0, Hollow and pretentious.
1, Freneticaly paced action flick truly thrills.
1," This is Allen's most perceptive, adult and finest work in years. It is as if filming in and around London rejuvenated his creative juices."
0," There's a certain stylishness from director Peter Webber (Girl With a Pearl Earring), but not enough good acting to make it stick."
0," Elba has put all the parts together and has given the film its necessary edge of danger, but somehow, the story is at loose ends."
0," Tediously silly, slapstick re-visit with the rollicking rodents..."
0," There are accidentally bad films and unapologetically bad films. Accidentally bad ones are sometimes sad, often boring. Unapologetically bad ones, however, tend to be neither sad nor boring -- and so it is with Unforgettable."

1," I've always found Empire to be the Hamlet of science fiction, basically because nothing good happens to the hero in the entire story."
1, Inspiring pro-union story is good watch-together fare.
1," When Lawrence plays to the cheap seats, the film comes to life. When she's the blank slate expected of a spy thriller, it falters."
1, ...adopts the posture of an empathetic listener.
1," Love Per Square Foot doesn't delve deep into matters of the heart, but it's a feel good film for sure."
1," Through the incorporation of multiple strategically placed cameras, including helmet cams, the filmmakers, who achieved a similar, grunts-eye-view in 2014's ""The Hornet's Nest,"" create an undeniably palpable experience."
0," It is unremarkable in every way, save one -- the cast is African-American."
1, It is so frenetic and furiously funny that it's over far too quickly.
1," What a little jewel of a film this is. Sumptuous looking... excellently acted and scripted, light on its feet but filled with a sense of purpose, and, at its core, a sharply observed character study. Hard to fault."
0," Would that the rest of the film were as engaging as Schwarzenegger; instead, it's a routine programmer that's short on thrills but long on tedium."
0," Ultimately, The Light Between Oceans is a hokey period romance masquerading as a morality tale."
0," Adam McKay's Vice is an energetic and entertaining look at the pursuit of power...but overall, the film's a mess and doesn't know what it wants to say about the topics it raises."
1," Bullock is variously hammy, cute, funny, cutely stressed. One, really, for fans."
1," In Pandora's Promise, Stone delivers some harsh home truths on the importance of nuclear power for our energy-drunk future. While it does make for uncomfortable viewing, the proof seems very much in the plutonium."
0," All that's expected from the leads is that they put forth a competent degree of mimicry; the secondary characters, meanwhile, are left with little to do but flounder."
1," A grandiose, audacious, exciting, sentimental, impassioned, philosophical, metaphysical, dense, epic mess. And you probably need to see it."
1," It all gets exhaustingly bombastic although, sequence by sequence, Man of Steel is something worth seeing."
0, Director Lasse Halstrom and cinematographer Sven Nykvist do their best to disguise the predictability with their own grace notes. But all the music in the world can't hide a tone this false.
0, Possibly the worst movie this year... or at least we can hope so.
0, ...mediocre black comedy.
1," It's Lupin, with his shabby dignity and tender concern for Harry, who's the emotional counterweight to the teenager's sadness and anger, and Thewlis brings great warmth to his father-figure role."
0," As a product, this sucker is assembly-line perfection which is fine if you're buying a pair of sneakers or a stereo, but for a movie, it is a little bit soul-crushing."
0," Although it faithfully captures the stunning art style of Brian Bolland, the source material itself just feels outdated."
1, So cleverly constructed that it's easy to be taken in and believe these twins really rocked.
0," Within 5 minutes, I concluded that no one over the age of 4 could possibly withstand more than 3 minutes of those hideous rodent voices without suffering permanent damage."
0," Rocky Balboa, the sixth (and hopefully last) installment in the underdog saga of the Italian Stallion, straddles the line between nostalgia and self-parody and frequently teeters toward the latter."
1," A true oddity in the Rankin/Bass collection, this little-seen special deserves a far better fate."
1," As in real life, it's neither sweet nor uplifting, but it's a must-see."
0," A 2D comedy shown with technology to make you believe you're seeing something you're not. And one of the things you're not seeing - or, rather, hearing - is witty dialogue. "
1, A multitude of pleasures abound if one gives into the insane spell the film casts.
1, The Duel drops us into a pool of languid provincial life ( ... ) Kosashvili gets the delicate falling ending of short fiction that is so hard to achieve on screen.
0," Reitman can't score on a single attempt because he telegraphs his plays before the snap. Everything in this movie is predictable, pat and entirely too dependent on split-screen cellphone calls."
0, The casting is all fine; everything else is pushy and out of joint.
1, Superior to any Batman except the 1989 movie.
0," I could rant for hours, but let's just say ""The Nut Job"" shouldn't be seen by people. "
1," Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen have mastered the art of subtle communication, amplifying the believability of their relationship in this ruggedly male bonding tale."
0, ...its positive message of self-esteem and female empowerment risks being buried under too many subplots. 
1," It may be missing the re1ing simplicity of The Raid, but The Raid 2: Berandal is a thrilling film that revives the visceral, tangible hand-on-hand tradition of action cinema. Get past the serpentine plot contortions and you'll have an absolute blast."
1, Admittedly this was a fascinating watch despite my reservations about the interview.
0, All the fancy footwork serves to bog down the movie.
0," At the end of the movie, a crawl tells us of the amazing accomplishments Seretse and Ruth did in their later years. And you wonder how much more satisfying this movie could have been had these been part of this story."
0, A grotesquely mawkish film ...
1," If the tone is uneven, if the ""comedy"" doesn't yield as many laughs as we're led by the ads to expect, that's only the collateral damage of the destruction Gunn hopes to wreak on the increasingly debased and tired genre."
0, [T]he movie banks on putting a lot of talented comic actors together in the hopes that they'll figure out some way to make the material funny.
0," This follow-up to the delightful 2011 reboot is only a shadow of that film, with some mild fun but never the same manic energy that made the previous film such a joy."
1," It's a great dynamic and it works but my favorite character isn the whole thing was Alan Tudyck as King Candy, such a hilarious throwback to the Mad Hatter from Alice in Wonderland."
1," If you're truly adventurous in your movie-going and fed up with movies that play by the numbers, play it safe and come with audience-fawning reassurances, then She Hate Me just might be the harsh cinematic tonic you crave."
1," The documentary's candid subject, important subject matter and involving story go as far as they need to."
0," Christian Bale is so bad that I understand that after seeing his performance here, the film ""Newsies"" is trying to retroactively remove his name from their credits."
1," The filmmakers manage that rare trick of weaving a pervasive blanket of dark mood, an almost suffocating sense of dread that sets up the boo-gotcha moments."
1," It's not about Bushido, it's about its representation."
0, If you part ways with $12 for a ticket to see this thing -- that's before parking and popcorn -- you're barking mad.
1," Quartet shows us how art illuminates our lives, and shows us artists and performers who can still, after all these years, do some illuminating."
1, Meg and Tom are the perfect couple for this movie.
1," A visual treat that's terrific fun for the whole family... gloriously silly and wildly hysterical, but also unexpectedly faithful and remarkably emotionally perceptive."
0, In attempting to turn the story into another version of Gladiator he's only shown he has no real idea what the story is about or what point he's trying to make. 
1," The new ""Tattoo"" is buoyed by Fincher's peerless craftsmanship. Never has a director been better suited to photographing winter scenes near the Arctic Circle."
0," It's not really worth the price of a visit to the art house, but might be worth a rental."
1," It's ridiculous in a lot of ways... But hot d---- is this ever a fun, rewatchable movie."
0, So good at being bad that it's almost admirable.
1," The movie, directed by Rob Bowman, plays more to the show's chief strengths: its macabre wit, its creepy-crawlie scares, and especially the tense, complex relationship at its center."
0," Predictably, the twists exist for their own sake and aren't grounded in character or theme."
0, A botched interpretation of the classic story that trades spectacle for coherence.
0," A remake in title only, this House of Wax is mostly inspired by The Twilight Zone and the Friday the 13th movies."
0," ""Earth to Echo"" is a flimsy excuse for a tribute to number 25 on AFI's 100 Years 100 Movies List."
0," Repetition or refinement: Kaboom is yet another Araki youth movie that chronicles alienation, eroticism, and sexual identity."
1," Don't Be Afraid of the Dark might not make viewers forget the television original they grew up with, but has enough under the skin creepiness to entertain those simply looking for a good fright at the movie theatre."
1," Imaginative, remarkable."
0, A considerably less interesting but not altogether worthless exercise in ham-handed social commentary and wanton violence.
1," It's the type of film you might expect to see at a fund-raising dinner or a convention banquet, not in a commercial theater. That said, it's a very well-made piece of boosterism."
1," After playing the ideal CIA chief in ""The Sum of All Fears"" and president in ""Deep Impact,"" Morgan Freeman can add God to the list of positions he seems tailor made for."
1, A low-key pleasure.
1," An espionage tale that's more sturdy and intriguing than thrilling, more ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" than Netflix's answer to Bourne or Bond. "
0," The most mystifying aspect of Kaala, in the context of a mainstream Tamil film, may be how ineffectual the deaths are..."
0," It's harmless, colourful fun, but even the very young are used to better."
0, You can put Melissa McCarthy in pretty much anything and expect to see it elevated as a result. Certainly she does this here: it'd be nothing at all without her. But even with her it's not enough.
0, You won't find much insight into relationships or the creative process in this breezy low-budget comedy.
1," With good performances and characters, Beginners is an enjoyable, amusing and occasionally poignant watch."
1, Friendly but matter-of-fact doc will play best with the troupe's existing fans.
1," The most deliriously inventive sci-fi action movie in years. Truly, this is a game changer. James Cameron may want to watch his back."
0," A Dog's Way Home is a fine family-friendly adventure about man's best friend, hitting the same emotional chords as (better) movies that came before."
0," Throughout Terrence Malick's film, the new and old are incessantly twinned, blurred into a package that suggests an experimental dance piece."
0," The performances mostly come up short. Wasikowska does sullenness well, but her sexual yearning reads as more of the same."
1, The film about of a teenage Chinese-American boy struggling with adolescent issues while working in his family's fleabag motel has the precise brevity of a well-crafted short story.
0," Kick-Ass 2 has nothing to say, and it says it in the most vulgar way possible."
0," The sci-fi stuff is egregious bunk, an arbitrary concoction of stock elements someone took three minutes to jot down on a bar napkin."
1," Hangover Square is a short (77 minutes) but effective little noir film, not on the same level as The Lodger but with a few tense, memorable setpieces, a solid score. "
0," Wild Hogs really doesn't spend much time on the road. Good thing, too, because after the guys are found sleeping side-by-side and skinny-dipping together, the writers must have run out of homosexual panic jokes."
1," While it might be fairly predictable and isn't the speediest of films, it's not bad watching this pot -- and plot -- start to boil. (Full Content Review for Parents also available)"
1," Wonder Woman has come to save us from ourselves in her long, long, long overdue cinematic debut. And in the best news of all, the wait was worth it."
0," The movie has plenty of terrible scenes but also three very, very funny ones. I laughed a lot during those three moments, sometimes rather guiltily, but barely managed more than a chuckle elsewhere."
0, Slick and energetic action-comedy showcase for Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz has nothing on its mind but pure escapism.
1, You should regret missing it.
1," Strong stuff, a film that scalds its subject - who still doesn't seem to understand what he's done that's pissed so many people off."
1," The Handmaiden is just pure cinema, a dizzying, disturbing fable of love and betrayal that piles on luxurious imagery, while never losing track of its story's human core."
1, Spike Lee's unconventional storytelling and theatrical dramatization go beyond the cinematic...
1," Enjoyably schlocky horror flick, with its tongue firmly in cheek, ensuring that there are several laughs to be had amidst all the gory, hatchet-wielding mayhem."
1, Anyone who likes mysteries and Kendrick and Lively as actors should find themselves pleasantly surprised by how well Feig makes this one work.
1," ""Cries From Syria,"" is, in many ways, an expansion on ""White Helmets,"" a feature-length look at the war; a film that, while not especially pronounced in it's structure or technical achievements, is nonetheless timely and devastating."
0," With all the good will in the world, I couldn't warm up to Kit Kittredge. The movie is like a 1930s or 1940s short about Americans pulling together, stretched out to feature length."
1," It's a massive film with a chewy center, yet the effort doesn't sink under the weight of its elaborate intentions. It's intermittently pleasurable, getting the franchise back on track."
0," Alas, the plot takes a sudden and sophomoric turn about halfway through that Kinnaman, with his decent thespian chops, can't quite pull off, though he tries mightily."
0," Austenland begs a couple of questions: One is why, Keri Russell, why? The other: Where is Christopher Guest when you need him?"
0," Starting with writer Karl Gajdusek's inane screenplay, the film is a hodgepodge of clichï¿½ï¿½s that gets worse and worse as it goes along. So bad it's almost wonderful, this is one motion picture that almost needs to be seen to be belie"

0, Carries an overpowering scent of writerly affectation.
1," Tornatore may have hit a sticky wicket with his subsequent work, but he knew what he was doing here: warning us about the irrational lure of the filmed past, which is to say cinema itself, then ushering us grandly to our seats."
1, The trick with 'The Avengers' is to satisfy each superhero's fan base while simultaneously divvying out each hero's scenes in equal portions. Director-screenwriter Joss Whedon has pulled it off with muscle flexing aplomb.
1," Brody expertly depicts someone broken and compassionate, disillusioned and giving."
0, Quit it with the CGI blood spurts. 
0, Basically a self-serving justification for the prominence of fluffy entertainment over sharply written and intelligently crafted stories.
0," A contemptible example of vile, relentless overkill."
1," Part 1 concludes with good and evil evenly balanced, both sides having suffered losses in pursuit of ultimate victory."
0, [It] ultimately suffers the same fatal flaw as Julia Roberts' evil queen: It doesn't really care about anything except how pretty it looks.
0," There's rapport between Steve Carell and Paul Rudd, well cast as the Odd Couple, but the source material (French farce), which was nastier in dissecting manners and mores, has been softened and the comedy is not funny enough."

1, A tremendously involving film which will keep you guessing all the way up to its shattering conclusion. 
1," I was certainly entertained while watching it, but I did feel so let down by what could have been a classic Coen brothers movie."
1," A solid, occasionally stirring, treatment of its subject."

0, Not nearly as speedy as it is silly.
0," Clint Eastwood's biopic of J. Edgar Hoover has elements of a good drama, but merely brushes over the various controversies in a suprisingly humdrum narrative."
0," The film, particularly in its first and last third, seems sadly devoid of imagination."
0, Below-average for series and too violent for younger kids.
0, The four-legged creatures are more compelling than their two-legged counterparts in this visually stunning 3D adventure.
1," A history lesson, a warning shot and damning personality profile, all backed up with expert interviews."
0, A change of direction in the solid multi-award-winning filmography of the young filmmaker. [Full review in Spanish]
0," A movie with the odd, tired joke about art and artists, a college romance that isn't romantic, and a plot twist that doesn't twist at all."
0," Even for a franchise that is horribly light on drama, nothing at all happens here."
1," Despite its failings, there's a lot of magic in this movie."
1," It's so well done, so diabolically effective, that it's not until the movie's over that you realize you've been suckered by well-worn gestures of the classic tearjerker."
0," It's not a totally bad film, it just makes a lot of bad choices and ends up dragging when it should be engaging, and it frustrates more often than it entertains."
0," Henson's both-feet-on-the-ground performance tries to rein in the chaos, but the simple fact is that she-and the moviegoers, many of them people of color, who will come out to see this film-deserve much better support behind the camera."
1," Endless Poetry isn't for every taste, but those who give it a try will find a celebration of imagination from a director whose sense of invention seems unchecked either by censorial impulse or personal inhibition."
0," The film isn't much of a read, though."
1," Girlhood shines a poignant light on black female friendship, and the presence of violence feels like an unfortunate attempt at projecting racial verisimilitude. What's far more interesting is the sight of these four girls enjoying each other's company."
1," An impactful film that deals with cerebral discussions around race, class, and society through the lens of liberal arts students."
0, The overall depiction of The Battle of the Five Armies makes all of the action so absurdly 'cool' that it feels like little more than fan service.
0, A garbage bin for contrived poetic platitudes and ruminations on sex and stealing.
1, Falls a bit short in several key departments.
0," The movie is very uneven in tone and in quality, with charming nonsense colliding with what appears to be devastating tragedy. "
1," What makes this ""It"" work so well is the way it pulls us back into our own childhoods with a cast of young characters and the shared experiences - some horrifying, some hilarious - that bind them together."
1," If you like the TV show, you're going to love the movie."
0," There is a point in filmmaking where the tasteful can become timid, and unfortunately this handsome period drama turns that corner halfway through its generous running time."
0," The film comes across as an irksome contrivance. What's meant to communicate the mysterious, even taboo allure of playing chameleon instead just leaves us scoffing."
1," The most gripping war movie you'll see this year, We Were Here tells first-hand the story of how AIDS attacked San Francisco, killing more than 15,000. Whole peer groups were happy, healthy, and then dead in months."
0, A movie that resembles Bugsy Malone with real weapons.
1," The sheer force of Audiard's direction can support such enigmas. It forces you, bullies you, persuades you to love his filmmaking style - even if not always to understand his motives."
1," Hilariously forthright about Steven's sexuality in ways queer problem dramas rarely begin to suggest, I Love You Phillip Morris lights a path for American gay cinema beyond niche-oriented indies and bigger-budget films about martyred role models."
0, Those looking for hilarity and hijinks with episode three will find the party is indeed over.
0," It's not the worst scary movie of the year. In fact, there are some flashes of what could have been a really cool horror film. But Juno scribe Diablo Cody's script is inconsistent in tone, crude instead of edgy and generally dull instead of hip and cool."
1, Bridesmaids busts through the party movie glass ceiling with a steel-toed stiletto and a tepid magnum of Yellow Tail.
0, Confusing WikiLeaks docudrama mostly avoids iffy content.
0, All this docudrama grit allows for precious little dramatic juice.
0," An oddball mï¿½ï¿½lange of action, slapstick, sentimentality and ghoulishness, all wrapped up into one big, galumphing package... more a curiosity than a delight, but the adventurous might want to give the sweet-and-sour dish a t"
0," It's [a] lack of thoughtfulness that should have kept The Darkest Minds on the never-ending stack of other unimaginative, copycat YA screenplays, never to be greenlit."
1," The argument in favor of The Square is not that it's great fun to watch, but that it's very entertaining to ponder after viewing. It lingers, both amusingly and disturbingly."
0," To put it plainly, both actors play unlikeable dimwits. [...] It's a shame that Bernal and Luna could not have had a better project for their reunion."
0, Movies are far too expensive to waste your hard earned money on this mess.
0, ...a festive film. [Full Review in Spanish] 
1," While the film has an even and perhaps slow pace, it skips from incident to incident so precisely that I was hanging on each of its movements as though it were an action thriller ... Kaufman's script may be some sort of wonderwork."
0," Disappointing, seen-it-all-before British drama that assembles the usual clichï¿½ï¿½s but fails to do anything interesting with them, thanks to a simplistic script, dull direction and some dodgy editing decisi"
0," Evil Dead suffers the curse of its own mediocrity: while it is really not bad, it would linger longer in the viewer's mind if it were better - or indeed worse. As it is, the fun ride is over and forgotten as soon as its brisk 90 minutes have elapsed."
0," It is, perhaps, a bit telling and awkward that the best parts of What Now? are less about Kevin Hart being funny and more about people reacting to Kevin Hart. "
1," Dreamlike in style, Police Beat is also a real-world vision of what American indies could be if they dared to recognize the drama in our own neighborhoods."
1, ...not as dumb as it might have been...
0, All but the faintest flashes of humanity and pathos are flattened by the cinematic cyclone that is Michael Bay.
1," The new Dawn won't be revered like the old one, but if there's a sequel, I'll shamble instinctively to the theater."
0, This gonzo 140-minute omnibus reserves a scene or two for any social or political concern you'd care to mention.
1," [A] thoroughly unique experience, one that is wildly cinematic in that it never lets you forget you're watching a movie, and yet one that is so enrapturing that you get lost in it..."
1, There's plenty in Rosewater to make you hope that Stewart finds another reason to get out from behind his desk again.
1," In Thelma, Trier transforms the environment of Thelma's college campus into an almost mystical battleground between faith and modernity."
1," There is no reason anyone should like Norman - in the wrong hands you'd walk out of the theater five minutes after the movie started. But Cedar and Gere make Norman someone you root for, after a fashion."
0," ""Angels Sing"" is a music video disguised as a holiday movie, populated by musicians disguised as actors."
0," More of an exercise in literary theory than emotion-driven filmmaking, The Hours remains watchable by the sheer force of acting talent possessed by Streep, Kidman, and Moore"
0," I couldn't stop laughing through the whole mess, and unless you have a high tolerance for pretentious, nonsensical, unscary crap, you'll be laughing, too."
1, It's the best kind of movie: so alive in its storytelling that only in retrospect do you realize that the ideas represent a metaphysical inquiry.
0," Despite Wu's sympathetic performance as an independent woman willing to sacrifice her own happiness, in the end it's still all about getting the guy."
0," Game Over, Man! is grotesque, violent, insane and offensive-in other words, it's kind of exactly what you'd expect from a 'Workaholics' movie unrestricted by basic cable censors."
0," But, sadly, it's not a good movie. "
1, Drishyam is an elegantly crafted piece of film which Lal and Joseph can proudly hold close to their hearts.
1," If Sleight wasn't so entertaining, one might be tempted to define it as a social drama in which we are witnesses to the lack of opportunities young black men are provided."
0, When smart people make dumb movies.
1," Speaking of religion is a delicate matter, but the honesty and cynicism Van Dormael uses to denounce it's incongruities will upset the more conservative viewers. [Full review in Spanish] "
1," If the human details are often problematic, the IMAX-grade bombast, ceremonial camera, and Jodorowsky-esque eclecticism still combine for a singular spectacle."
1," It's endlessly arguable and open for debate. At the very least, we can all agree that Banksy has found a new wall on which to plaster his art -- that of the silver screen."
0, Cadillac Records exists mainly as a holiday throw-away for those with a deep and abiding love for the kind of music it showcases.
1," Bridesmaids is likely to be a hit with both women and men, being half formula chick-flick, half raunchy comedy of humiliation. It's hilarious -- and too bifurcated to be satisfying."
0," What's strangest about The Hangover Part III is how, well, not funny it is. I don't mean that it makes a bunch of jokes that don't work; I mean that there are not a lot of jokes. "
0," The 139-minute movie is perfectly on course till the interval point, after which it steadily collapses under the weight of its ambitions."
0, There are only two explanations for why anyone would make Pokemon: The First Movie: alien abduction or drugs.
0, A virtual big-budget explosion? Yes. A spectacle of three great actresses making fools of themselves? Sure. MTV-worthy martial arts monages that shamelessly rip off The Matrix? Yessireebob. But a movie? No. Not for an instant.
1," Based on a heroic true story, The Finest Hours is realistically terrifying (thanks to impressive special effects and score), but also a miraculous feat that warms the heart."
1," Wreck-It Ralph plays out a little like a screwball comedy, with Vanellope absolutely vexing Ralph because of her energy, her enthusiasm, and her wide-eyed naivetï¿½ï¿½, with Ralph coming around as reluctantly as Cary Grant in Bringing Up B"
0, Favreau had the opportunity to do something remarkable with Cowboys & Aliens but instead ended up making a movie that feels completely underwhelming once the credits start rolling. 
1," Nemo, with its ravishing underwater fantasia, manages to trump the design glamour of earlier Pixar films."
1, Eric Elmosnino is terrific as the louche French icon in Joann Sfar's vivid biopic. Shame about that second hour.
1," Wyrmwood is a heady mix of make-shift cars, chopped up limbs and gore-soaked True Blue Aussie muscle, which places it somewhere between Mad Max and Peter Jackson's early splatter movies."
1," Every once in a while, for reasons as random as a Hollywood executive's taste or an economic meltdown, a perfectly decent movie slips through the cracks, never receives a theatrical release and is relegated to the purgatory called straight-to-DVD."
0," If watching this makes you long to be young again, you probably grew up in an Algerian prison."
1," a gorgeous film with stunningly dark imagery, but it follows too many other movies instead of its own path."
1," Few directors are building a better body of work than Noah Baumbach, the New Yorker whose deft contemporary comedies are growing in snappy wit, barbed compassion and social critique."
0," A movie that bets the house on the interplay between an all-American archetype and a reserved, fragile looking traitor who walks and sounds like a bank clerk. That's not enough in a film built on legal conversation."
0," While the first two films skirted by on charm and sheer energy, At World's End clunks through three hours of excessive characterization and exposition -- and none of it makes any sense."
0, This family-friendly animation gets off to an amusing start but soon flies off into la-la land.
1, Top of the line Preston Sturges with wonderful Barbara Stanwyck and surprisingly funny Henry Fonda.
0," There are no characters, only types, and Solondz doesn't seem to have affection for any of them."
0," The filmmakers present the movie as having more depth because it is inspired by true events, but opting for seeing it on a pure fictional level is a far better choice."
1," Through interviews with whale scientists and several former Sea World trainers, [Cowperthwaite] paints a disturbing picture of the profit-minded climate of deceit that prevailed at the company."
0," David Frankel's film reduces an extraordinary life to a predictable template of bullying, resolve, success, disappointment, and platitudes - a pattern repeated two or three times until the genuinely moving finale."
0," I did laugh a few times, but I equally found myself smacking my forehead in annoyance of how stupid these characters were sometimes."
1," While ""Detroit"" may try and cover too much ground and occasionally stumble on its ambition, the sheer visceral power of Kathryn Bigelow's direction is worth championing."
1, This isn't the Grade Three incarnation of Harry Potter anymore.
0," Even black comedy requires that the filmmakers love someone, and the mock cruelties in Burn After Reading come off as a case of terminal misanthropy."
0," The Cloverfield Paradox tries to tie into its 2008 forebear in a much more literal sense, and the result feels spectacularly inept."
1," More story than testosterone, more time-jump-cuts than spacey filler, and more war-as-hell than war-as-cool. Leaves you pondering if we're 'masters of our fate' or just action-figures going through the emotions in some supreme player's idea of a war game."
0," The winking, self-reflexive tone mutes any possible emotional investment."
1," This movie is obviously a dream come true for Condon, and he delivers it with precision, care, love, and intelligence."
0," The well laid out setup-rickety home, poor neighborhood and lively clan who lives off their grandma's gov't check-makes you think their brushes with the law and experiences with irate shopkeepers will lead somewhere. It doesn't."
1," Although Ms Maier (or Ms Mayer, or Ms Meyer, or even Ms Smith, depending on what name she was using at the time) remains an enigma, there is still plenty in this film to keep you planted in your seat."
0, It's hard to believe you'd be squinting at your watch in the dark while two of the most charismatic actors in Hollywood are on the screen in front of you.
0, Bruce Willis sees robot surrogates instead of dead people in this fairly entertaining sci fi flick
1," Stupid it may be but it's a lot better than the last two episodes. The plot is easier to follow, the special effects are even more spectacular and, for once, the movie has an acceptable leading man."
1," Many viewers will find echoes of their grandparents, parents, or even themselves in these characters."
0, Is there any place left that torture porn won't go? Not now.
0," The Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hard could have been more agonizing to sit through. As is, it is merely a disposable failure. The film just wanders along, complacent and insincere as it heads down a dead-end street."
1," Austere, brilliantly acted, and punctuated with flashes of genius...one's appreciation for Burning will depend on one's patience for tedium."
1," A thriller aboard the Trans-Siberian line, stretching roughly 5,000 miles from Beijing to Moscow, should be a cinch, right? Not so fast, Casey Jones."
0," It's confused and confusing, by turns hilarious and off-putting. In short, it's awfully hard to love I Love You Philip Morris."
1," The Boat That Rocked is pointless, shapeless, historically bogus and so emotionally disengaging you can't even feel the soundtrack."
1," On a technical level, The Book of Eli is smooth and assured."
1," McCarthy said she purposely resisted toning down Lee's antisocial, caustic, angry and miserable attributes. It is striking, then, that McCarthy's award-worthy performance as a decidedly unlikable woman is exactly what makes Lee Israel so captivating."
1," This was more interesting than I thought it would be not just because it shows how much work, thought and creativity goes into such a show, but because of the deep connection to film in this project."
1," If The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers seems less transparently inviting than its predecessor, this quality has less to do with the film than with the quest itself."
0, This is sham feminism in the first degree no matter how colorful the animator's palette or how cool fire-breathing dragonflies are in 3-D.
0, Swank's scenes with the students spark with such energy that the rest of the movie... reminds you how formulaic it all is.
1, We can all only hope that we'll get to see Adonis on screen for just as long as we've seen Rocky.
1," The routines and rituals of prison life and the boxers' training regime create an almost hypnotic spectacle, defined by the give and take of sparring body shots and repeatedly massaged limbs."
0," It comes apart about halfway through, losing a very difficult tonal balance. Having said that, there's more to like here than the studio burial would have you believe."
1," An immensely engaging sci-fi thriller about friendship, leadership, and loss in a tense and war-mongering intergalactic world. "
0," Normally, I'm eager for a story about a woman humiliating herself for love, but the tone of this fanciful film at times struck me as all wrong. "
0, A juvenile test of one's stomach and patience.
1," Questions of identity abound in ""Young."""
0," You can detect a flicker - one might even say a ghost - of an interesting idea beneath its polished shell. But at every turn, Ghost in the Shell sacrifices the opportunity to actually say something interesting."
0," Overall impact is muted. Oddly, too, the film is somewhat shortchanged by its great star, Johnny Depp, who disappointingly has chosen to play Dillinger as self-consciously cool rather than earthy and gregarious."
0," Jake Gyllenhaal's performance is definitely worth seeing, although Southpaw as a whole doesn't quite live up to the high standard he sets."
1," Quibbles about the film ultimately are as unimportant as a bit of undigested beef, a blot of mustard or a crumb of cheese: 'Ghost Town' is for real."
0, Far too much of the running time is eaten up by our would-be lovers running through the streets in slow motion to sad-empowering M83 and M83-style music.
1," Fine performances by all, with Leonardo DiCaprio a stand out."
1," Australian tale of a holiday gone wrong has a potent, distinctive creepiness."
0," If you want to take down Waiting to Exhale, you'd better have a stronger grip on men and women and how they connect or fail to connect than this."
0," I didn't laugh. I didn't even smile. I just never cared. And cinematographically, the film is much uglier than any television series watched at home for free on your HDTV."
1," A sprawling tale of sexual obsession with strong performances and a jet black streak of humour lurking just under the surface, though there isn't quite enough story to justify its epic running time."
0," Most of the time, I found myself feeling like I was waiting for a turn with the gaming controls."
1," An empathetic, if not entirely persuasive, look at an ongoing national dilemma."
0," Shame the flick's just a one-note joke because, sight unseen, Bad Teacher had me at the title."
1," What it [arguably] lacks in passion, Admission makes up for nicely in heart with Tina Fey and Paul Rudd at their light dramatic best."
0, The preposterously silly and bullet-riddled From Paris With Love is so leaden and obnoxious that it actually makes you long for the John Travolta of Old Dogs.
1," ""Fahrenheit 11/9"" treats the viewer like a kindred spirit, rather than ignorant student, and takes all the stuff we know and fleshes it out with nuance and scrutiny."
1," Funnier would have been better, but the warm inclusiveness makes its point."
0, I laughed during this movie ----- once.
0, Rampant silliness and gaping plot holes test audience patience in Jeffrey Nachmanoff's sci-fi thriller.
0," Beneath the bad dialogue, bad chemistry, bad editing and bad pacing of the film, a much darker and more serious issue lurks."
0, [Reitman] has opted to make what a friend of a friend told him a Judd Apatow romantic comedy was supposed to be.
1," You finally got me, Will Ferrell. I surrender."
0," While admirers of the director's work might sit still for the glacial pacing, the overlong film becomes steadily less involving after a promising setup, trading mystery for a sentimental vein fed by its sudsy romantic score."
0," Ferrell and Reilly do the man-child thing again, only this time it's R-rated and not quite as funny."
1," ""Attack the Block"" demands to be seen simply because it is a thrill - a pulse-raiser whose perfect construction and pointed wit make it one of the year's most exciting films."
1, Toy Story 3 continues Pixar's unique tradition of sending grown men out of the theater pretending they're not crying.
1," Emotional cruelty through sexual manipulation is the rule of the game of this smooth transfer of Christopher Hampton's witty play, with an all-American cast, headed by Glenn Close and Michelle Pfeiffer."
1, Rich and strange mystical film that is filled to the bursting point with dream images and bizarre characters.

0, A beautiful ending can't erase the abundant dull moments beforehand.
1, [A] good-natured and spectacular comedy...
0, The simplistic plot (the migration and father-daughter plotlines are identical to Ice Age: Continental Drift) is so obviously structured that even a Neanderthal can see it coming.
1, It seems telling just how many other musicians were willing to participate in the documentary to attest to the outfit's influence.
0," A long running time, too many characters and too much whimsy and corn make this romantic romp more of a slog than a soufflï¿½"
1, a heaping helping of corn pone laced with a glittering cascade of glitzy production numbers
1," Light, fun, and will leave you talking about it. [Full review in Spanish]"
1," Brisk and involving with a streamlined forward propulsion, it's the kind of superhero movie we want if we have to have superhero movies at all."
1," Although Heller's debut does have some stylistic flourishes, this is not an exercise in style, but a re1ingly honest film, both funny and sad, about growing up female in all its messy complexity and wonder."
0," What is it about the biopic genre that gravitates toward the same sea of cliches, no matter what the sound or era?"
0," Though the tale, adapted from Stephen King's best-selling novel, starts out with an eerie sense of foreboding, Dreamcatcher fails to deliver thrills and chills."
0, Like a 2 1/2 hour infomercial about sharing your feelings that replaces any true emotions with some of the most ridiculous and useless spiritual rhetoric you're ever likely to hear.
0," Without the rotoscoping, the movie would be completely undistinguished, competent but only mildly entertaining."
0," The story is disjointed, but from what I gathered, the life of a Queen, just plain sucks... except maybe for the wig selection. "
0," This sometimes heavy-handed sermon about political apathy among the young, the stakes of media collusion with government, and the fog of war is almost certain to scare off the people it is intended to reach."
0, It's hard to enjoy a film peopled by so many unlikable people.
0," BJ McDonnell, too hesitant to stray from the beaten path set by Green's previous films, lacks the looser, more whimsical hand that would have allowed Hatchet III to transcend its thoughtlessly imitative state."
0," The movie falls apart, and flounders to the end, because it doesn't know what its funny is supposed to be."
0," It's a whimsical comedy and, as far as whimsical comedies go, it is quite whimsical, and sometimes comedic, which is fair enough, but ultimately it is slight and repetitive and nothing sticks in the mind."
1," Perks deserves points for going beyond the typical coming-of-age drivel aimed at teens. Logan Lerman excels as Charlie and Emma Watson makes a dream girl to die for, but the movie is stolen, head to tail, by Ezra Miller."
0," Wong Kar Wai's first English-speaking feature bears some artistic merits, particularly for viewers unfamiliar with his oeuvre, but overall it's a disappointing work."
0, Falls back upon one of the most tired and clichï¿½ï¿½d plots imagina
0," While technically proficient, overall House on Willow Street is much ado about nothing, making it another piece of low budget genre fiction hard to get excited about and even more difficult to recommend."
1," An action movie that's smarter than it has any right to be, and often glorious to behold."
1," Greenberg will do a lot for Stiller's reputation and Gerwig's profile, but its awkward, messy humanity and uncomfortable honesty won't necessarily do a lot for ticket-buyers more used to lighter, warmer and breezier entertainments."
1," Because of its outre subject of lesbianism and one sexually graphic scene, Aldrich's well acted, lurid melodrama was slapped with X-rating upon its release."
1, As harrowing and beautifully constructed and fully-experienced as any other work of 2011 cinema.
0," It's possible, even likely, that more effort was expended on sculpting Alexander Skarsgard's abs for The Legend of Tarzan than on providing good reason why the movie was made."
0," For all of its vices, I can't help but think that we've brought Getaway on ourselves. It's not the car chase film we need right now, but it's probably the car chase movie we deserve. And if the finale is any indication, a sequel could be ready to go."
0," Get rid of the Vicky, and it might be passable."
0," The film drains the spark from four talented young actors with clunky dialogue and a crushingly dull narrative. The special effects aren't that special, either."
1," They might not all be the most pleasant people to spend time with in real life, but on screen, it would be hard to do better."
1," Witherspoon ... gives a star-making, revelatory performance."
0," It's re1ing, at least, to see a YA film that doesn't feel the need to hide behind a postapocalyptic conceit."
1, A visual extravaganza with dazzling special effects.
1," ""Anomalisa"" finds an adult story that could only have been effectively achieved through animation, and then realizes it with precision, sensitivity and shocking humor."
0," Franco allows unidimensionality to become an ingredient of its history by denying it growth, suspense, tension, crescendo, humanity, art and development, for not seeking or not wanting to look for a real cinematic discourse. [Full review in Spanish]"
1," It is a fitting climax to a dazzling trilogy that goes way beyond the comic book sensibilities of its character, creating a larger-than-life, flawed and complex hero who ... continues to battle to save a city and its soul."
1," This movie is everything Hancock wanted to be, but failed to deliver."
1," Funny, romantic, insightful teen tale has a little swearing. "
1," The filmmaking here is exquisite, not only in its ability to engross us in the manipulations of one man administered on the volatility of another, but in its ability to completely immerse us in another time..."
1," One of those quiet, thoughtful Indies that comes along every once in awhile-leaving an impression. "
1, Feels as if it could keep the genre alive and singing all on its own.
0," A shallow, confusing, 2-1/2-hour slog through the life of legendary French designer Yves Saint Laurent."
0, It's hard to imagine many children or adolescents sitting through this big-budget ($250 million) but uninolving Star Wars knocokoff
0," If anyone was clamoring for a follow-up to 1999's Baby Geniuses, they'll be happy to know that the sequel retains not only the same gimmicky premise as the original but its preference for cliche-ridden dialogue and flat-footed comedy as well."
1," If Jones doesn't quite pull it off, it is at least a film of many pleasures and a thought-provoking look at American literature's most famous loner."
1," Receives a big boost from bleached-blonde leading lady Binoche, whose showy mood-swings qualify as action set-pieces."
1, 'The Upside' uplifts its audience.
0," Von Trier says he was suffering from severe bouts of depression when he shot the movie. See Antichrist, and you'll know the feeling."
1, Pohlad's film is good at probing the line between radical creativity and mental disarray; arguably less good at getting Wilson back on the safe side of it. But it leaves you in no doubt that the man's a genius.
1," Although each Jurassic movie is fated to essentially repeat the same idea-oh no, dinosaurs!-this new era has come up with ways to surprise, terrify, and inspire, which is enough to keep the heart of the franchise beating."
1," A disturbing, finely acted showcase that sheds new light on female angst and its place in office politics."
1," Boon's film is both funny and heartbreaking, a supremely confident mix of political satire, free-floating paranoia, fractured family dynamics and the kind of comedy that regularly reconfigures itself into tragedy."

1," The camera becomes a revolutionary: running, chasing, breathlessly jittery, up in the face of interrogators."
0," The film is much more interesting in its amuse-bouche diversions, including a surreal and emotional trip to the battlefield at Gettysburg."
0, Put it in the recycling bin. This version of Robin Hood is embarrassing.
0," This sequel takes what goodwill we had, douses it in kerosene, lights a match, and laughs as the flames burn higher and higher."
0," Starts to feel like a trip to Azkaban long before it's over. Rowling has previously promised five ""Fantastic Beasts"" movies, but it's clear she barely has the imagination to fill one of these things."
1, A diverting exposï¿½ï¿½ of the frippery of film folk alternates with a moving look at grief in all its everyday profundity; scenes of comedy shift to reveal a tragic undertow -- these are hard things to pull off but Mia Madre does them with quiet author
1," The lack of explanations in The Ruins may prove unsatisfying to some, but the unknown is often more terrifying than the tangible. Such are the wages of fear."
1," The movie delivers the same old American action-flick themes of catastrophe narrowly averted, but the Korean version alters the meaning from triumph to sorrow."
1, Agreeable cheese.
1," It's heartwarming and validating, but you want to see where it leads."
0, Wilmer Valderrama and George Takei's reaction shots are the only feeble sources of humor in this dramedy.
0, The Watch is a predictable and lazy comedy wrapped around a penis joke occasionally enlivened with some funny lines.
0," The piano-dominated score tries to run its fingers up and down our spines. The actors try their best. It's the script and plot that let everything, and finally everyone, down."
1," Hirokazu Kore-eda's new film is the sleeper hit of 2018. The Japanese filmmaker has become a master of humanity, his films are true reflections of how we as flawed individuals are embraced by those closest to us, family."
1," Endlessly inventive and impeccably realised, it's tough to find fault with this freaky, feisty fable."
1, Even those well-acquainted with the genre should find enough to enjoy in the stylish set-pieces that feature plenty of bloody action.
1, It's immensely educational...and dry as a soda cracker. 
1, An outrageous modern morality play.
1," There's also some gallows humor about the record and newspaper industries, but overall this is a light, genial comedy about denial and self-defense."
0," Satisfyingly sturdy and no-nonsense, a multiplex monster smartly constructed from tried-and-trusted parts."
0, The Accountant starts from nowhere and reaches nowhere as it keeps oscillating between a good idea and an average execution. The film seems longer than its 120-minute length.
1," The movie is willing to see its ideas all the way through, while not entirely giving up on plot, and Eisenberg is unafraid to take himself where Reichardt needs him to go, which is right under our skin."
0," The beats the movie hits are predictable enough that, after a rousing, raunchy opening act, the story of the group's fast rise and spectacular flameout begins to feel like an exceptionally dirty-mouthed after-school special."
0," There are a couple of genuinely funny sight gags, but most of the roadside attractions of Wild Hogs are either boring or outright annoying."
1," As a chronicle of midnight and dawn in the great human day, Dark Days ranks among the most moral of films. "
1," Some of the lines are brilliantly campy, and that provides a fun action film."
0," As good as Rob Lowe's was, Matthew Lillard is Shaggy."
0," As someone who's been playing Warcraft games for over two-thirds of my life, Warcraft was just good enough to make me aware of what could have been -- and just bad enough to make me despair that it wasn't."
0, Full Throttle is silly in the extreme and works best for audiences who are as undiscerning as its creators.
0, A return to that sunny outpost for the elderly and infirm ushers lightly diminishing returns.
1, This heady and very entertaining documentary is the cautionary tale of a con artist who tricked wine experts into spending fortunes on rare vintages which weren't at all what they seemed.
0, The lack of focus on a single story makes it feel more like a highlight reel or infomercial more than anything.
0," There are many different kinds of children's movies, and this one tries to be all of them at once -- including one of those in which the children are smarter than the adults."
1," Narratively, the film may be an uneasy blend of genres, but technically it's brilliant, with lengthy set pieces-- staged and shot in gritty style with handheld camera by ace lenser Emmanuel Lubezki and his team--that should serve as textbook material."
1, A wonderfully creepy tale [containing] another Oscar worthy performance by Robin Williams.
1, The script slyly pokes fun at the beatification of pregnant women and is smart enough to consider the serious issue of infertility at the same time.
1, Brewer has a firm command of the material and a great sense of how to film dance sequences. Can't wait to see what this filmmaker does next.
1, The kind of movie that's talked about well after the credits roll.
1," With three fantastic lead performances and a healthy dose of style, those who can appreciate an action-packed black comedy will savor the ride."
1," [Boots] Riley is swinging for the fences here, with a clear vision of what he's after, and on the whole, he succeeds tremendously. It's a fantastical, weird, funny, devastating movie, and it proves Riley is a director worth watching."
1," A film made with love for the simple, cool and assured cult genre classics such as Rollerball, Robocop and Escape from New York."
1," Lucas returns the series to its roots, delivering a cartoon-like adventure that uses special effects to enhance rather than replace storytelling."
1," Wonky science aside, this is exactly what you want from a disaster movie."
1," Paul Weitz has created a perfect role for Lily Tomlin, a woman who matches her innate wisdom, charisma and wit."
1," This movie may seem, by plain description, like putting your heart into a garlic press. But it's extraordinarily alive."
1," McKellen puts an indelible stamp on Holmes. He gives us a more seasoned, crankier Holmes, a former detective who's trying to stop a decaying mind from turning his own life into an unsolved mystery."
1, Classic Davies territory and a potent reminder of why he is a director to cherish.
0," Despite its over-the-top zaniness, this romantic comedy manages to keep us entertained with its starry cast and a nutty plot. If only the filmmakers had resisted the urge to exaggerate both the humour and the sentimentality."
0, The dread is thick and the atmosphere is so heavy that every simple car ride or bedtime story seems like it's happening on the crumbling edge of a lonely cliff.
1," Even if some details have been massaged to fit the template of a Hollywood crowd-pleaser, the main thrust of the story is true and all the more remarkable for that."
0," When asked why he would step back into the ring, even though he's out of shape and in his late 50s, the Italian Stallion mumbles something about ""the stuff... inside,"" which sums up the thin justification for Rocky Balboa."
0, The script is lacking and the acting merely serviceable in 'Terminator Salvation.'
0, Shyamalan's carny act already feels like it's decades old.
0," Many are the film's hackneyed scenes, although Eastwood and Adams always make them at least enjoyable to watch. Trouble With the Curve doesn't hit the ball out of the park, but neither is it a compete shutout."
1," [The Square is] funny, has an act that turns a person's world and family upside down, has lots of uncomfortable situations, and uses a dash of surrealism. "
0," Like a lot of movies, Astro Boy has been designed to function on different levels and serve different audiences, but in this case these multiple meanings and points of address have created a confusion of tone."
0," It's all too easy to read Blame It On Fidel as a simple morality tale, an allegory comparing conservatism to childishness, and political awakening to emotional maturity."
0," While it seems a good idea to have 1 directors on each new film, veteran Roger Spottiswoode doesn't seem to bring much to the party."
0," [Xin] experiments with contrasts, long takes and blocking, sometimes with hypnotic and obsessive detail, but in the process only proves to be a filmmaker determined in all the wrong ways. "
1, Agnï¿½ï¿½s Varda and JR's film develops into something approaching a manifesto for the possibility of shared happin
0, A weak sequel that will only appeal to those that can be satisfied by the prospect of buff half-naked men.
1," Wendy and Lucy is a film of small details and unassuming craftsmanship. It may be too slight for some, but if you let it get under your skin, it packs a devastating emotional coda."
0," ""Bethlehem"" comes off like a character study without much character."
1," Yeah, so I'm a big old sap. In any case, this sucker plays."
0," Not quite as good as it should have been, despite spirited performances from Black and Stiller and Christopher Walken on top crazy bonkers mental form."
1," Transpecos, a remarkably assured first feature from director/co-writer Greg Kwedar, takes a simple story of cross-border drug smuggling and crafts a riveting drama in the scrubby Texas desert."
1, You may not trust the facts in American Hustle but you can rely on it as one of this year's most aggressively entertaining films.
1," It's been 14 years since The Incredibles, and superhero movies are a lot thicker on the ground now, but writer-director Brad Bird has lost none of his wit and ingenuity; he can still show them how it's done."
0," Not without aesthetic interest, the movie is still a complete mess, weighed down by an expositional script and extremely mannered performances."
1, The film makes a overwhelming case for Assange as a political prisoner. But Poitras doesn't yield to hagiography.
1, An inspiring story of courage and triumph.
0, Offers little that Scorsese doesn't offer with more ï¿½ï¿½lan and 
1," Completes possibly the most improbable cinematic hat trick in Hollywood history: An unpromising series that began with three patchy, uneven entries has now produced three terrifically entertaining ones."
0," It's all breathless in the sense that every cast member sucks in his or her gut, chest puffed out, posing rigidly, half-naked, like Crossfit propaganda posters, reading lifeless lines."
0," A boring, cheeseball mess of a finale."
0," Furthers Eddie Murphy's transformation into Bill Cosby. Two things are wrong with that. Bill Cosby already is Bill Cosby, and Eddie Murphy used to be Eddie Murphy."
1, I'm betting on Mark Wahlberg for best actor when the Oscars swing around next year.
0, we can hope that the steady march of progress will render this movie entirely worthless in the not-too-distant future.
1, Fans of the book and film should rest easy at how this 'Dragon Tattoo' is still inherently a Swedish tale - set and partly shot in Sweden - and Fincher doesn't flinch from the sexual violence at their core.
0," The movie wants to be an instant Sidney Lumet classic along the lines of ""Serpico"" or ""Prince of the City,"" but it doesn't have the roots. It's new money."
1," While their situation feels futile, the film is almost poetic in posing important questions."
0," Jake fans will love his sleeveless arms and long hair %u2013 alas, the rest of the film is hardly as memorable."
1," Basically, you'll love it if you love Potter and you'll hate if you hate Potter, but if you're just looking for some fun in the theaters you can do far, far, far, far, far worse than Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows."
1," A thriller with a historical basis, 'The German Doctor' is a somewhat fictionalized glimpse at a ghastly real-life villain."
1," It's often at its best when it's off on a moody tangent. But it has something and is well worth seeing, especially if you're a horror fan or a fan of art cinema"
1," If you don't flee, you might be seduced. If you don't laugh, flee."
0," Old Dogs doesn't just roll over and play dead, it is in fact lifeless."
0," With its soap-operatic performances, bonkbuster plotline and sparkling seafront setting, all 'Adore' really lacks is a cameo from Alf Stewart"
1," Pro wrestling fans are the obvious target audience for ""The Wrestler"" but Rourke's fine performance, Aronofsky's craftwork directing and the well-written script by Robert D. Siegel should garner interest from others, too."
1," One of the best films of the year, if also one of the hardest to initially get your head around."
1," Like its flight-challenged parrot protagonist, Rio takes a while to get off the ground but manages to soar by the end."
1," Though it's rather clumsily scripted, formulaic in structure and sometimes contrived, Out In The Dark is strengthened by its subtext and elevated by tender, affecting performances from the leads."
1," Worthwhile for bringing these war games to light, but the filmmakers probably could have cut together their footage with narration and graphics to make it more interesting."
1," We come for the eye-popping visuals and the snarky humor, but we're touched by the emotional ties of the characters..."
1, Approach as you would an impressionist painting.
0," It's compassionate work with all the good intentions in the world, but Moverman refuses brevity, transforming what should be an unforgettable education into an indulgent slog. "
1," A good film, amusing, skillfully written, and it wouldn't do for it to get buried entirely."
0," I was glad to see them again, but it's probably time for them to go get their lives fully together now"
1," Wiseman's work takes on the moral density of a Dickens novel. It's smart enough to find the moments that show our civilization, as big and complex and troubled as it is, is still worth fighting for."
1, Let Me In represents one of the best and most brutal vampire movies to come along in a while...
0," Any filmmaker who celebrates ""a triumph of the human spirit"" risks falling into hagiography. And that's what happens with Jolie's Unbroken, which dramatizes Zamperini's wartime ordeals as his Stations of the Cross. "
0," As the story turns darker, more churches burn and the violent acts escalate, the tone falters."
0, The writing and directing continually treat the audience like idiots.
0," No matter how much it may adhere to the well-documented specifics of Zimbardo's work, it is a massive failure."
1," As unapologetically entertaining as Boyle's winking tale about fate is, it brings with it recognition of India's worst social ills."
1," The arc of its story may be as old as the hills, but Daldry and his amazing young star, Jamie Bell, make every moist-eyed moment seem utterly, vitally new."
1, There are lots of moments of levity and humor...these are interesting characters. 
1," There's no real narrative, just three folk in latex OAP masks snorting and cackling through a series of often noctural adventures with wheelchairs, hookers and undead-looking street poet types."
1, The greatest meta movie about a killer tire ever made.
1," Maybe the quips and the punch-ups are there because they have to be, what with the film's steady parade of failure and even death. Plans fail. Character fails. Even sacrifices fail. It's not exactly re1ing, but it is bracing, and even gratifying. "
1," From the - 'wait how did he get there so fast?' moments, to the cringe and chuckle-worthy one-liners, you know this movie came to play."
0," ...Veers back and forth between pointless and preposterous, with a pace so slow it's like watching film develop."
1, An action movie with some failed attempts to bring emotion to the characters and situations. 
0," ...if you're half-distracted all the time, you might be impressed by some of the interesting ideas in this film and be able to ignore what an overall mess it is. "
0," Full of half-truths (e.g., the French government his characters praise was thrown out of office after the film wrapped), this is just more of Moore's pathetic propaganda"
1, This is a wild movie in a Lynch-lite mode.
1," Gut-churning violence animates a potentially great film, about a great man, troubled by baffling decisions behind the camera. "
0, A more accurate title would be Not Much Fun With Dick and Jane - Carrey and Leoni keep this watchable but it's painfully light on laughs throughout. 
0," Just another disjointed, fairly predictable psychological thriller."
0, The stellar cast and promises made by technology only adds to the layers of disappointment. 
1," It's accurate to say that ""Palo Alto"" is another movie by another Coppola about the lives of the rich, bored and disaffected, but that description sells the movie short."
0," The film simply is what it is, and that is boring."
0," The second Anchorman movie will remind you how much you liked the first movie. Until, eventually, you forget."
0," Had this film come out 14 years ago, it would probably still be a late-night video treat, rather than looking a mite tired."
1," The Roman rulers used to distract the populace from the problems of corruption and decadence with ""bread and circuses."" Today's equivalent might be junk food and television, especially ""reality"" television."
1," In this echo chamber of fame-for-fame's-sake, real life imitates reel life. There's a lurid, Felliniesque sheen to Garrone's floating camerawork; this is reality tweaked, dialed up to 10.1. And there's a cheeky, sideways satire of Roman Catholicism."
0," Affleck is too personable to be convincing as an amoral scumbag, especially when the crocodiles gather to make acquaintance with a stooge who's fallen into disfavor."
1," As taut and disciplined as its characters, Full Metal Jacket ranks with Dr Strangelove as one of Kubrick's very best."
1," We haven't seen much of J.Lo on the big screen of late and her superstar charisma remains undiminished, while there's an earthiness and sincerity to her performance that allows her to convince as a mere 'civilian'."
1," Winslet is outstanding, particularly given that Hanna is such an unsympathetic character. We never quite feel sympathy toward her, and it's testament to Winslet's skill and confidence that she never really asks us to."
1," It's big and cheesy and if you're in the mood for a dose of exaggerated end-of-world chaos, this is the popcorn movie for you. Roland Emmerich has gleefully combined every possible disaster extreme with child-like enthusiasm: massive visual effects"
1, Get Out manages to walk the tight rope between being laugh-out-loud funny and genuinely scary at times.
1," 42 seems savvier than it tends to let on. A stiff production, it's still enlivened, as it were, by the hilarious stiffness of Ford."
0," Gore acknowledges early on that there is an unbridgeable ideological divide with climate change deniers, so An Inconvenient Sequel amounts to a monotonous minister preaching to a bored choir."
0," Scott never manages to reach that next gear to really make it special. It's competent, but you likely won't feel as if you've just witnessed a modern-day classic by the time the credits roll."
1, ...the unmatchable chemistry between Bryan Cranston and Kevin Hart saves this film. I would even go so far as to say that they elevate it.
0," Bigelow is too talented a director to make a film this unsubtle. Detroit is a classic of example of: Just because you can do something, that doesn't mean you should."
0," The usually strong actors are adrift without a decent script or story, resulting in a film that doesn't live up to the legendary name of the studio"
0," Between the Predators' dripping their glow-in-the-dark green blood and the Aliens' getting their rubber cement mucous all over everything, this is certainly a very sticky movie, though not, ultimately, a very frightening or commanding one."
1," While blockbusters ooze testosterone and claim bragging rights to macho action heroes beating their hairy chests, way in the background is a lineup of sweet little indies like this one, with sensitive guys wearing their hearts on their sleeves instead."
1," The Forbidden Kingdom may not be a classic martial arts movie, but it's got heart, a certain sneaky charm and more than enough pure fun to make up for that."
1," The performances are all very good indeed, and the film's serious, concerned tone suits the subject matter."
0," This British drama gets increasingly lurid as it goes. And its handling of risque material is sensationalistic, even exploitative."
0," ...the film's critical fans-seem to think he's breaking new ground. He's not, and the resulting film is more disappointing than the hype surrounding it lets on."
0," It's a heist film with a muddled plot, a character study with no personality."
0, Not a single scene works as anything more than a total waste of good film.
1, An engineer pursues his dreams in Miyazaki's latest (and hopefully not last)
0," When The Promise sags with cluttered, obvious tropes that have similarly downgraded countless war movies before it, it's a disappointment."
1, This megadose of Spongeyness is laugh-out-loud funny. A lot.
0," As the film goes back and forth in time, it is better to clarify that the protagonists are all women, and that men serve a generally pathetic role. [Full review in Spanish]"
0," It feels a little bit like that fourth dirty martini - not a good idea at the time, and probably to be regretted later."
0," Aims for ridiculous comedy, hits ""ridiculous"""
0, Violent 1980s martial-arts movie is a campy guilty pleasure. 
1," Watching [Aksel Hennie and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau] play a kind of cat-and-mouse game, with unbelievable stakes, is pure entertainment."
0, So-so romcom about unlikely couple isn't too racy for teens.
0, The satirical social observations about class warfare and the elimination of poverty by killing the poor are really just an excuse to get the motley crew of sociopaths into the house.
0, ...like a video copy of The Ring which has so degraded that all the good bits are no longer visible.
0," Off World is marred by compromises in quality that probably come down to economic constraints, and lock first-time director Mateo Guez into decisions that give his film the odour of desperation."
1," The key to the film's success is Ralph Fiennes, who does a dazzling job of portraying three of the sons of the house of Sonnenschein..."
0," The colors, the textures and the endearing characters are there, but soemthing seems to be missing in this sequel. [Full review in Spanish]"
0," By trying to inflate one remarkable life story into the chronicle of a generation, Daniels fills what could have been an inspirational, personal saga with a lot of hot air."
0," Overall, Saoirse Ronan is a marvelous, powerful actress and Hanna is a great character. Perhaps a sequel to the film Hanna will have a script worthier of both. "
0," Fun peppers his cast with Hong Kong action film royalty while filling the screen with crazy titles and text overlays, which almost distract from the problems with the way he and writer Chia-lu Chang have unfortunately structured their film."
1," 17th Century English political philosophy meets 21st Century Russian fury in Andrey Zvyagintsev's bone-rattling epic, Leviathan."
0," Either the filmmakers suckered these [pro-Darwinist] participants under false pretenses, or the evolutionists are more open to debate than Stein suggests."
1," Just because it's a familiar story, though, doesn't mean it won't hold you in the palm of its hand as it guides you through the filmography of the quintessential American filmmaker."
1," Clooney's account of Murrow's historic assaults on Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, in 1954, imitates many of Murrow's best qualities."
1," Amazingly, Spielberg... has managed to suppress his own worst excesses and create a movie that does justice to Dick's ideas."
1," It's a special kind of film that can rely on children to drive its story and maintain its charm, but A Boy Called Sailboat pulls it off, evading some of the pitfalls of the quirky indie comedy to deliver something truly wonderful."
0," It leaves no lasting impression, except for one excruciating scene involving a bone marrow transplant."
0, A narrative in search of a story
0," In another lifetime, Michael Moore and George W. Bush probably would have been great friends."
1, What a funny film it is.
1," DaCosta directs in a modest, slice-of-life style, which only heightens the tension of events on screen - this is the kind of movie you lean forward to hear, and before you know it, you're overwhelmed."
0," The dull and tedious splatter-fest See No Evil is, sadly, not even half as intriguing as its skuzzy pedigree."
0," Every bit of action is in service of the big moment meant to blow your mind. Alas, you touch your head and discover your mind remains intact, largely unstimulated."
1, Manages to win the viewer over in spite of itself while further perpetuating the myth of Peter Pan as an eternal headcase.
0, The movie plays like a global-political farce made by people who've never left the Upper West Side.
0," Take this one with a chaser of your favorite ""Die Hard"" memories and hope that the series goes out on a higher note. John McClane deserves better."
1," Phone Booth is not rocket science. In fact, it's a popcorn movie, but it's a popcorn movie of rare quality."
1," Splashier than X-Men, better than Spider-man, Daredevil is a marvel. Each frame is packed with comic-book joy."
0," Apatow continues his assault on gentility and good taste with this roll in the gutter that degrades women. The sad part is that there is a good, sweet movie lurking here behind all the vulgarity."
0, Watching The Last Witch Hunter is like sitting by while someone else plays a game whose coolness eludes us.
1," For those who enjoy tear-jerkers, ""If I Stay"" will provide a satisfying three-hanky experience."
1," With many writers and directors keen to give a look at a future ravaged by impending war, it's a breath of 1 air when someone shows an evolutionary leap towards harmony."
0," Some directors, it must be said, only have one really good movie in them. We're starting to worry that Richard Kelly may be among this select group."
1," As we meander through the aisles, it is melancholy and poignancy that become the driving forces, and this switch in tone is slightly too jarring. It's the only fault in an otherwise outstanding feature."
0," A movie you observe, rather than one you enter into."
1," Director Irwin Winkler and screenwriter Jay Cocks know that Porter's songs are his story, and so they take care to weave his tunes seamlessly into their movie's structure."
0," The filmmakers present the movie as having more depth because it is inspired by true events, but opting for seeing it on a pure fictional level is a far better choice."
0," The boasts get louder, the bling shinier, but the film itself just gets increasingly monotonous."
1, The Villainess works best when it's not concerned with its plot and story and focusing on presenting intricately choreographed visceral action that builds to bloody crescendos.
1," For better or for worse, we'll never again see television quite like that documented in the compelling ""Best of Enemies"" ..."
1," This is a phenomenal character study of the grief of a father and the guilt of a friend. If you find it's unfolding too slowly for you, just focus on the wonderful performances by Redford and Freeman, and they'll pull you through."
0, From Afar resorts to a socially demoralized vision that condemns both Armando and Elder.
0," Alas, the second time proves no charm for The Pink Panther 2, Steve Martin's latest flimsy attempt to resurrect Sellers' bumbling Inspector Clouseau for the 21st century."
0," Chillingly devoid of laughs, and looks like some deconstructionist experiment, deliberately draining the comedy genre of jokes to show the parched, pointless story-skeleton beneath."
1," Charm and sweetness were in short supply in Michael Bay's ""Transformers"" films, but they're the secret ingredients to ""Bumblebee,"" a likeable prequel that indulges in nostalgic affection for all things 1980s."
0," The film's message is so powerful, some of the poetic flourishes are unnecessary."
1, Even pacificsts love guns.
1," While On the Road is a series of impressionistic moments, it would be a mistake to dismiss it as aimless."
1," The tension builds in a slow boil, then ignites furiously when we're not quite ready for it."
1," The world may not need yet another swashbuckling epic adventure, but one with so much heart and soul and fantasy surely is a welcome addition."
0," IO is just not very riveting, character or plot-wise. And that's saying something when the fate of the planet, the greatest human drama of all, hangs in the balance."
0, Seems to have been made without a writer.
0, Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium is what happens when too many sappy sweet instincts chase too few original ideas.
1," A lot of people will relate to 'Border' in terms of beauty, romance, internal and external conflicts while also developing a more open understanding of other cultural and personal differences. "
0, It's a fatuous film with none of the weight and dark energy of The Exorcist.
1," This film should be celebrated as one of those purely cinematic experiences, which these days are all too few and far between."
1," Scene after gorgeously hand-drawn scene offer a visual feast, but two hours of it is a bit too long."
0," The grave tone makes it stiff and leaden, the digi-saturated look is a turn-off. Damnable and disordered."
0," It sounds like a weird, potentially wonderful action-comedy. The problem is that it never really hits the absurd heights of the premise. "
1," There's fantastical fun to be had here, but be sure to check cynicism at the door."
1, The movie has a brain.
0, Perplexes as much as it entertains with a strong left of centre ideology clashing with the conservative roots of its action western genre.
0, Quickly wanders from a funny look at life at a crossroads to an obvious series of embarrassing nonsense and basic observations about nature and people.
0," Offers little to separate it from the likes of Mad Max, The Road, or numerous others mining the same ground."
1," There is plenty of action, the acting is good and the story is good enough to get by. It is not a bad film. It is about like the first film in the series."
0," all meaningless movie mechanics, nothing more."
0," Attempts at giving this ""Stand by Me"" meets ""The Sandlot"" an ""edge"" are overwhelmed by efforts to rub that edge off."
1," A bravura turn by Hoffman, plus Fosse's kinetic direction make this an unforgettable biography."
1," A striking, challenging character study that manages to maintain its roots even when treading into psychological thriller territory."
0," It is time that Victor buries the hatchet once and for all, and gets out while he is ahead - or at least not totally behind."
0, Dark Shadows gets stuck in neutral because of the uncertainty as to what kind of a film it wants to be.
0," Raees is a sporadically fun, but frequently tedious attempt to reinvigorate the style of films that made Bollywood in the '80s an exciting place to be."
0, Trash like The Fast and the Furious really boils my blood.
1," Christoph Waltz matches Lecter, Vader, and the Wicked Witch of the West with a performance that shows off his fluency in English, German, French, Italian...and evil."
1, The film has a visual timelessness that adds to the other worldly mood
0," Even at half an hour shorter than the previous movie, Resurgence feels padded, full of go-nowhere subplots and pointless supporting characters."
1," Gillespie has imbued his film with black humour, while never undermining the authenticity of the characters or detracting from the abuse that runs through the story."
1, Avengers: Infinity War is the most Marvel movie that Marvel has ever Marveled.
0," A forgettable, middling exercise in violent dress-up."
1," The best part of it are the cameos and homages of horror legends like John Landis, Joe Dante, Adrienne Barbeau and many others. [Full review in Spanish]"
1, The highlight of this documentary are the interviews with the alleged perpetrators of the crime leaving the audience to question their responsibility. [Full review in Spanish]
0," Provides the Halloween franchise with a clear, objective Worst Movie Of The Series...a virtually flawless collection of all the things that can make a slasher film unwatchable."
0, Swank has the wherewithal to make a panting madman reach for his tape and handcuffs.
1," Director Shawn Levy is a certified lightweight who always goes for the easiest emotional payoff. But Hugh Jackman's lovable as a loser, Dakota Goyo has spunk and charm, and the robot battles are genuinely thrilling."
1," It represents a clean break with the ""immersion for immersion's sake"" mold where virtual reality film started, and points a way forward for work to come."
1, The landscape of the heart is an emotional mine field only the French seem able to navigate with any sense of delicacy.
1," Godzilla '98 is big and it's noisy, and while it's not particularly good, it is just good enough."
0," In an age when so many teen movies are grasping so desperately for message-y topicality, it does the impossible, and manages to be about nothing at all."

0," At times, you feel you can see the character - and by proxy the writers - actually thinking, ""So what now?"""
0, Keen to follow the Judd Apatow formula -- crude gags plus big-hearted sentiment -- Dirty Grandpa winds up losing the courage of its gross-out convictions. Offensive in all the wrong ways.
0," ...a hoary mixture of trite nerd jokes, lame physical comedy and fairly basic Star Wars references that actually condescends to geeks under the guise of celebrating their peculiar culture."
1," Seventh Son has all the requisite parts: witch hunters, witches, a naive apprentice, dragons, simple townsfolk and, err, guys with axes for arms."
0, There's no sense of wonder in Prince of Persia and that's a shame because it's a film which should be built almost entirely on wonder.
0," Overall, most everything about this film doesn't work."

1," Not one enigmatic person in The Door in the Floor asks to be liked, but you like them anyway."
0, A lifeless follow-up.
1," Without [Woodley], ""Divergent"" would be a grim slog indeed."
1, Reminiscent of German Expressionist horror films-The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari in particular-Mister Babadook himself is a masterpiece of design and implementation.
0," The director, who shares writing credits with Parveez Sheikh, succeeds at setting up an intriguing if convoluted premise, but then struggles to take his characters and story anywhere interesting. "
1," The movie has charm, at least, if nothing else. And as an attempt to pay homage to a vanishing world, La La Land is as dutiful as it is endearingï¿½ï¿½ï¿½-ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½sweet, if a littl"
0," If the movie is a lost cause, it may at least showcase actors who have better things ahead of them."
0," ""Everything, Everything"" doesn't even set up a bar for Maddy and Olly to overcome, instead insisting on the idea that we should just make believe like mindless children."
0, This controversial thriller does not go beyond polemic.
0, Three-hours-plus is an absurd amount of time to sit through the visual equivalent of thumbing through the NYPL's program guide.
1, But Travis Knight's spin-off/ prequel shrewdly -- and successfully -- sidelines the mechanics and mythology of its predecessors to focus on the changing emotional conditions of its characters.
0," But I should say, if you take out the part about the dumb premise, the acting is quite good--it almost makes you forget you're watching the big screen version of the tv show ""Quantum Leap."""
0," Marking time until Roos gets tired of spinning his webs of astringent, pithy, smug little nothings."
0," A film that neither annoys nor amuses, and that seems billed by a mathematical algorithm. [Full review in Spanish]"
1, Snowden does a remarkable job of walking viewers through the ten year evolution of a man from unassuming US soldier to cyber-intelligence operative to the world's most wanted man. 
1, Michelle Williams is excellent as a married woman struggling with her passions.
1," An easy contender for one of the funniest docs of all time...It's gut-busting, can't-breathe funny, but introspective and knowing as well."
1," Few movies of any era offer so much varied food for thought, cinematically and politically. Its new restoration is a major motion-picture event."
0," A stodgy, ridiculous movie with a horse that simultaneously serves as an allegory for the bond that unites all mankind and as a symbol of profound, idealized purity."
0, Disa can't really satirise society's homogenised speed-freakery when his songs feature Ronan Keating and his animation looks scarcely finished.
1," These characters are more than what we see on the surface, and it's thanks to Leigh's rigorous yet generous eye that we never just gawk at the drama."
0, It's not that 'Firewall' is a bad movie --- it's just not that great. Plus I am so over Harrison Ford.
0, Got 2 hours to kill? Spend them elsewhere.
1, Its edgy tone and dark atmosphere coupled with its comic-book theatrics make it a winning combination for older children and adults alike.
1," It's a thing of beauty to watch Ethan Hawke and Kristin Scott Thomas work together, but we'd be lying if we said we understood this drama."
0," A bumpy entertainment about a bumpy road to the altar, this overly long rom-com offers up a couple of laughs, a thought or two and a lot more extraneous stuff."
0," Prisoners is weary after ten minutes, and I suppose it has persuaded itself that its length is justified by its solemn gaze into the abyss."
0," At no point does the movie manage even a single sequence of sustained tension, or a frisson of genuine terror."
0," It all comes off like a bad episode of The King of Queens, just moved to a different borough."
0," The poster is cute, the trailer cuter. ""Paul"" the movie? Don't ask."
0, The lads duly lurch from one bewildering crisis to another.
0," There's no point to it, just a series of gags -- in both senses of the word."
1, Grim docu about rural poverty is emotionally intense. 
1," Just watching it induces veritable stomach cramps, though it's impossible to turn away from the film's whipcrack construction and expert manipulation of perspective."
1," Johansson has reinvented herself as a sci-fi specialist in recent years, and is excellent here as the automaton with a troubled soul."
1," When not downright creepy, it's quietly damning of an administration willing to point all the wrong fingers and play up all the wrong angles before brushing the matter aside."
1, This pleasant little piece of overly-familiar fluff is nonetheless moderately entertaining.
0," The movie transforms a dim idea -- ""Elmer Gantry"" lite -- into comedy that's dead in the water and as dull as it is broad."
1," A bittersweet love story. Due to its fragmented structure, the dramatic arc never seems satisfying enough, although Rachel Portman's beautiful score weaves a melodic rainbow through the exposition"
1, Farhadi remains a master not just of narrative but of empathy. He's a war correspondent constantly shifting perspective in clandestine battles.
0," Weeping is invited, but by no means required."
0, This movie could have benefited more from character development. It is painful to watch talented actors wasted in their roles.
0, A respectable but watered-down heist movie.
1," Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is a wildly imaginative, but uneven film. Some parts are fantastically dark, then it loses steam in stretches."
1, captures a tapestry of humanity rarely seen
0, The chief - though hardly the only - problem with Victoria & Abdul is that too much political correctness proves to be as bad for drama as too little.
0," By the end of its ninety minutes, this fun little flight of fancy starts to feel an awful lot like work."
1," Rush Hour, starring Chan and Chris Tucker as a couple of mismatched cops on the trail of a kidnapper, is more of an American film. Although it features plenty of Chan's mind-boggling physical agility, it really showcases the comic abilities of both men."
1," It delivers what it promises, which is muscular guys in skimpy clothes fighting and howling, as well as some large-scale digitally enhanced battle sequences."
0, Not how Eichmann was captured but how did he stay free and living easy for 15 years on the worldwide lam?
1," Thomas Allen Harris's film offers a fascinating glimpse of the early campaigns of the African National Congress, and the way childhood memories can obscure larger truths."
1, This is one of those ur-stories that actually feels like a slice of ancient wonder and grandeur...
1," Intensive Care is worth watching for its charismatic lead, Tara Macken, who has good stunt and martial arts skills. But overall, the final product languishes in mediocrity. See it because you're a fan of the low-budget action movie genre."
1," Labor Day manages to avoid grand gestures to a large degree because of its cast. Both Winslet and Brolin initially come across as noticeably stilted, but with time their restraint speaks volumes about the sadness haunting both characters."
1," Quaid and Richardson are appealing and have believable chemistry together. And Hendrix is a real hoot, as are scene-stealers Lisa Ann Walter and Simon Kunz, playing James and Elizabeth's hired help."
1, [P]owerfully moving...
0," Corny, wildly misdirected and downright ridiculous. But, kinda of fun, too. Maybe you'll like it, maybe not."
1, An art-cinema landmark... There's no doubt that it's partly a brilliant directorial sleight-of-hand.
0," Strong cast, weak story in comedy with some racy bits. "
1," An eye opening expose' not to missed, which reveals a 'New Russia' that looks a lot like the 'Old Russia.'"
1, ... it is famous Polish actor Boguslaw Linda who dazzles with his hidden volcano of emotion.
0," Like pretty much everything else bearing Happy Madison's name, The Benchwarmers kind of sucks."
1," Most of Homecoming proceeds according to reliable Marvel formula, with solid but generic direction from Jon Watts."
1," A triumph for Marvel, Disney and blockbuster filmmaking. By fusing the best parts of the 18 movies behind it, the sum is considerably greater."
1, Museum Hours is one of those artsy-fartsy meditations on life that you see sometimes in the better cinemas. The good news is it turns out to be more artsy than fartsy: There's plenty to think about here.
1," The film's sense of tension is real, and built on realistic moments."
1, Director Roger Donaldson and screenwriter Dennis Feldman show an unexpected flair for the exploitation form.
1," The film stumbles a bit in the end, when the exact nature of the perils within and without are made clear, but up until that point, 10 Cloverfield Lane is scarily suspenseful stuff."
1," A super-slick thriller that doesn't let up, with exceptional performances all round. Make sure you catch it before the inevitable US remake rears its head."
1," Isn't it OK, once in a while, just to enjoy the spectacle of two beautiful people kissing in a train car in the shadow of an elephant?"
0, A thriller that cannot be taken seriously. Incompetent on every level.
1," An educated and transparent film, which tries not so much to reconstruct or imitate reality as to recreate it on the inside and make it possible in the strict margins of the myth. [Full review in Spanish]"
0," The guns might suggest it's shaping up to be an action spy caper, but it's just the wrapping for a romcom, like when pet owners shape mince into pellets to conceal medication from their dog."
1, It's the cinematic equivalent of Pop Rocks and soda.
0, Samuel Maoz's portrait of four young Israelis manning a roving war machine on the first day of the 1982 Lebanon War is solely an experiential affair.
0," Everything seems forced, false, and finally pretty darn dull. For a romantic comedy, the movie is notably shy on any kind of real romance and the comedy shelves are pretty much bare."
1," This enchanting fairy-tale, the first release from Fox Animation Studios, is pure family entertainment."
1," Glossy and engrossing, Human Capital unfolds like a variation on one of those films that spend two hours showing how a handful of seemingly unrelated characters are connected."
0," Director Zhang Yimou, the darling of art-house cinemas the world over, tries his hand at a fantasy adventure epic and achieves only low camp, albeit with his customary eye for brilliant color and striking tableaux."
1," Scott Fitzgerald once wrote that, ""There are no second acts in American lives."" The Ram would have to agree. But Rourke may be living the second act his character never could."
0," But as it sputters toward its curtain-exposing conclusion, ""Level 16"" stays disappointingly thin, both as a dark-future cautionary saga and a genre exercise."
0, Silly and stale with far too many extraneous characters. Its multiple false endings becoming monotonous far too soon.
1," ""Don't Blink"" is a portrait of an artist, a portrait that draws upon Frank's own improvisational approach to filmmaking, but which also manages to capture a life's story, as well as its subject's essence."
0," Tears of the Sun is war fluff for the lobotomized Hollywood crowd, a transparent and thin effort without rhythm, depth, thrust or even basic structure."
1, Our Kind of Traitor replaces the book's stings with the film's melodious strings.
1, A barkingly enjoyable ride.
1," It is sophisticated yet innocent, and while always accessible for young fans it never suffers from a lack of dialogue, with the straightforward and breezy story easy to follow and fun to enjoy."
1," The planets in the new galaxies are creatively different yet familiar, beautiful and ugly, habitable but not habitable. They have their own histories and realities and have no interest in being colonised by the US of A."
1, Rogen and Byrne spark well together and Efron is an amusingly primped doofus while director Nicholas Stoller keeps the energy going despite scattershot plotting.
0, At least 10% more exciting than correction fluid.
1, This charming Disney adventure (with just a touch of evil wizardry and black magic) is bag-of-tricks fun.
0, We wonder how many moviegoers will want to sit for well more than an hour and watch a largely repetitious performance that amounts to a sheer artistic stunt.
1," Only Chuck - a libertarian redneck who simply wants to be left the fnck alone - has the red, white, and blue balls big enough to put an end to these problems."
1," Like Mumbai, Slumdog pulses and throbs with raw, unadulterated life and the hope for a better Bombay, today. It's brilliant."
1, It's good. I mean really good.
1," This 1978 labour of love, one of the most immaculately filmed rock concerts, preserves for posterity the final appearance of the Band, the great group led by Robbie Robertson that had been on the road (often with Bob Dylan) for 16 years."
0," In the end, this is a film that even Madhavan cannot make better. Here is one honest question for the makers: why make a film that looks like a farce even on paper?"
0, Amelia goes airborne but never fully soars. It's hampered by a too-reverential portrait of the record-breaking aviator.
1," The picture still stands proud as a comedy easy chair of sorts, but even more vividly as Tom Hanks's finest hour as an actor."
0, The supernatural and its accompanying history of half-vampires and vampaneze never establishes itself as anything but ridiculous.
0," [A]n awfully nice movie, with its heart in the right place... [but] deeply incompetent [and] chock full of terribly clichï¿½ï¿½[s"
0, Flashy - with a high-octane frenetic - aimed at a small-fry audience.
1, One of the slowest and most deliberately minimalist science fiction films ever made.
1, Sober and reverent.
0, Catwoman is worse than bad -- it's boring. So boring it's not even laughable.
1," It's a hit and miss hour-and-a-half that lacks the charm of the first movie, but Zoolander 2 raises just enough chuckles to justify Derek's return to the big screen."
0, A technically well-executed but flatly by-the-book and heavy-handed satire on the corruption blighting Romania.
1," A blockbuster romance that looks and feels like an indie film, all in service of an expression of pure love."
1," The real revelations of the film are in Michoacï¿½ï¿½n with Mireles, but don't expect solutions, or clear lines between good and evil, to eme"
0, Ludicrous plot turns makes Reeves' wooden acting the least of the film's issues.
1, Becomes so enthralling and intense that perspective viewers shouldn't be surprised if they forget to breathe for minutes at a time.
1, The film gets its biggest laughs -- and there truly are some grandly bleak belly-shakers here -- by upsetting the apple cart on traditional gender roles.
0," Seeing Jude Law spread his actorly wings to create a lovable antihero is fun and endlessly watchable. The film around him, however, never coheres. "
1," This enormous movie is as much of a reflection of its protagonist as its director, offering a window into an exclusive world as it is conceived and formed in a dream."
1," Every member of the cast came out to play, starting with Tom Hardy's physical and... interesting performance. [Full review in Spanish]"
1," Involving rather than totally gripping, but with an unimpeachable ring of authenticity."
1, The film survives some dodgy dialogue because of a strong supporting cast.
0, ...the dialogue is so muted and dialed-back that it leaves little room for those delivering it to establish themselves as individuals.
1, Michael Fassbender brilliantly plays Steve Jobs.
0," V for Vendetta is not a movie of ideas so much as it is an idea mall. By the time you've gotten through it, you feel spent, loaded down and more than a little disoriented."
1, A debut feature that replaces the Coen brothers' humor in similarly labyrinthine comedies of errors with Arthur Penn's grit and Peckinpah's tense string tuning.
0," [1920-Evil Returns] may not be a sequel, but it uses the same old notes to scare us. The difference between the two is that while the earlier one had some scary moments, this one is massively mirth-inducing."
1," Stage actress Sandra Huller delivers a stunning, understated performance..."
1," In her passionate debut film, Green achieves a feat of making a two-level research project informative and entertaining. Exciting and essential documentary for film history!"
1," Coogler excels in his narrative with great storytelling and doses of humor in a story we all know, while inducing a ""realness"" factor into the typical sports movie melodrama (no easy task). [Full review in Spanish]"
1," Never Let Me Go is strangely moving and mournful, but I wish more had been made of the beauty these people are relinquishing, if only as a counterweight to all that artful drear."
1," A Super Trooper of a sequel that is energetic, fun, and lively. It's an irresistibly fun time that you won't want let go of."
0, Why not Billy Redemption? Billy RiseAboveAdversity? Billy ComeOnYouCanDoItBuddy? We can do this all day.
1," For all the raucous, and beautifully choreographed slapstick, the best comedy comes from the characters themselves in a story that allows for exquisitely hilarious small moments that are the equal, if not the better, of the bigger ones"
0, Solid performances and a literary feel help turn a standard family-rift drama into a dry but saucy narrative.
1, Affleck is good enough in the role to chase away rumors that he was only cast because he was sleeping with the director. 
0," Pusher faithfully mimics Nicolas Winding Refn's 1996 Danish crime saga while missing its nasty, grungy spirit."
0, It's easy to place a camera on a sad child and immediately generate sympathy - this isn't a film as much as it's a two hour infomercial for your local church's outreach program.
0," Disappointing when it isn't mind-numbingly dull, the reboot of Poltergeist is a tedious, cynical failure of cinematic science."
1, A movie easier to admire than to love.
1," In some ways, the movie is tame for Lanthimos, far less obtuse than his previous works, but The Favourite is no less complex in its portrayal of women, sex, and power."
0, There's no way to endure the movie without earplugs and a blindfold.
1," If you want a poster-friendly snippet, Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa is a truly splendid British export, fit to burst with character, idea, charm and heart and not to be missed by anyone who's partial to the sheer joy of quality comedy."
1, McCarthy's bloody and beautiful novel comes to life under the Coen's able touch.
0," Super-fans will get their fix, but everyone else might feel like they're being hammered into submission by a major marketing plan."
0," Without a strong story or well-defined character to guide her, McCarthy resorts to old tricks and repeated routines."
1," On this rich and emotionally satisfying evidence, lower budget, intimate and psychological takes on the incredible just might be the way forward."
1, It almost kicks the atypical chick flick onto its Oprah-sized backside.
0," Newness will occasionally remind one of the raw talent Doremus has, but a screenplay like this one leaves him narratively stagnant. "
1, It's a reality that might best be encountered when you're in the right mood for it. 
1," Aside from its cast, the winningest aspect of Colaizzo's script is Brittany's emotional arc, which avoids the expected path."
1," It may cover some ground the director covered in Goodfellas or Casino, but nothing in those pictures can match up to the mania on display here."
0," Jennifer's Body is not funny, nor is it sexy (the girls keep their clothes on), nor is it scary (it's all just special effects)."
1," Demands that kind of close attention, and rewards it as well. "
0," When you hear the giraffe yelling May Day, right at the beginning of Zookeeper, take heed; it's a distress signal that we are about to witness a disaster"
0," If it's a good heist movie you're after, there are surely better ways to go than with this limp caper."
1, It's like a champagne bath laced with arsenic.
1," Seven Days loses a little of its focus as it approaches the finish line, but hovering desolation stops it from surrendering to Condï¿½ï¿½ Nast smugn"
1," First-time director D'Onofrio has as an admirable visual style, whether we get medium-long-shot takes or intimate close-ups. This is a good-looking period piece film, percolating with top-tier performances."
0, Films like Get Him to the Greek have already done a far superior job with madcap this year.
0, How much does this movie suck? Let me count the ways.
1," This melancholy romance is the first Almodovar feature I've ever really liked, an expertly fashioned melodrama that steers mercifully clear of his usual puckishness and star-mongering."
0," Going back to the beginning and seeing where it all began, this film had a lot to live up to in my eyes. In the end, I was just left wondering what all the fuss was about."
1," It's Kramer's fury, channeled through Ruffalo's manic energy as the writer's alter-ego Ned Weeks, that keeps The Normal Heart beating and preserves a horrific bit of all too recent history not in amber, but in anger."
1, What makes the effects work all the more impressive is how they are used to support story ideas rather than to serve as gratuitous eye candy.
0, It's a sad case of Red opening up her goodie basket and finding that there's nothing there.
1," Interesting, downbeat directorial debut by Michael Keaton marred by a needlessly ambiguous ending."
1, The actors' raw emotional expressiveness lends the picture its memorably gritty impact.
1, Leans in to the notion that Thor laughs in the face of danger by creating a movie that invites the audience to laugh right along with him.
1, Lanthimos snaps out of the mannered sameness that was threatening to suffocate his work.
0, ...introduces us to a fascinating world and then turns away from it in favor of a drearily generic romance. It's like taking a kid to the zoo and only looking at sparrows.
0," These women clearly get a kick out of flouting convention and there is something admirable in their spirit of defiance, but the doc is average TV at best."
0, Most of the film's shortcomings stem from the awkward combo of modern-day grotesquerie and fluffy romantic exoticism.
1, Maggie Smith as Miss Shepherd is plenty on her own.
0," Chuck doesn't stray far from from the underdog, just-a-lug-from-the-streets redemption arc that Rocky itself helped eternally popularize."
1," I'd suggest taking off your Ron-tinted glasses and accepting that the first film isn't flawless, and that this isn't likely to top it. From there, proceed to laugh your ass off."
0, Narrative spunk ultimately tapers off to a series of slick but silly plot devices that drag the action over the finish line with a resounding and disappointing thud.
0," The stolid inertia of this story is so joyless that the film's sole ""passionate"" element is the desire to garner Oscar consideration for Close's performance."
1," It's frustrating to spend six hours with a film and still feel like you're missing something. Even if he shrugs his shoulders about where it all leads, Gomes is among the very few filmmakers compelling enough to follow down that kind of rabbit hole."
0," Maybe we do deserve another Twister, but to showcase the advances in effects since you really need a bigger budget than this."
1," With strong performances from all three leads and great chemistry between them, Our House breathes new life into old horror tropes."
0," More often than not, ""12 Strong"" feels like a sports movie, where all the stakes rest not on matters of honor and duty, but on a single field goal."
0, Ultimately cloying and unfocused ...
0," Draining as it is to endure, Andrei Rublev is an intensely devoted act of respect for the artists whose brilliance and courage were equally essential to keeping the Christian flame burning through the darkest hours."
0," The film is slow and boring, with the story weighed down by pointless scenes and a regular hollowness that saps the energy out of the piece."
0, The third entry lacks the subtle power of the previous two efforts.
0," Gooey dreck that attempts to be a quirky comedy, an earnest drama and a warm-hearted fantasy about the Nazis - and fails mightily at all the above."
1," In short, Aquaman has tons of basic dialogues, a finite plot... and battles in hundreds of liters of water. [Full review in Spanish]"
1," It's not so much deliberately confrontational in the way so many experimental films are (or pride themselves on being), but rather risk-taking for the sake of something almost impossible to articulate -- even if based in something obvious."
1," Tight direction by Fleck keeps the tension where it needs to be, and he guides his key actors through the intricacies of the script with an even hand."
1," With wit, understanding, and directorial smarts, The Diary of a Teenage Girl makes for an uncommonly loveable debut and adaptation. "
1," McPherson has managed a rare hat trick in genre mash-up, fashioning a deeply absorbing movie that balances horror, romance, comedy and observant humanism with surprising finesse."
1," Landi's cinematography is appropriately unsentimental, filling the wide screen with dark pavements and chipped concrete buildings. But D'Emilo finds colors in the character's emotions..."
0, This promising doc fails to capture the Cannon spirit
0," Consistently, astonishingly, inventive ... relentlessly and ruthlessly vile. Style may ultimately not be able to triumph over content, but it's one hell of a fight."
0," The stakes might be high, but never once do they produce even a frisson of delight, horror or tension."
0," Yay! England sucks and India is cool! Well, except for that troublesome caste system, of course."
1," Unflinching as it is unconventional, this gory composite of multiple genres also might be the first thinking man's slasher film. "
1," While even the film itself cites the heist as ""Ocean's 7-11"", it's got a flavor and energy all its own. It's a blast from start to finish."
1," There are indelible single scenes in Happy Ending, but without the strong scaffolding of Haneke's usual craft, the all-out nihilism feels shallow."
0, Films like this don't need a lot of logic to survive but credibility goes out the window a few minutes after it starts and never returns. 
0," 'Concussion' moves the ball, but is as subtle as a blow to the head"
0," This is definitely the worst film of the series, and probably the worst horror film I've seen all year."
0," I suppose there is something to be said about the juxtaposition of such incredible physical beauty and the ugliness of the actions in support of it. But in the end, there's still not much to be said, period."
0, A melodramatic potboiler that stretches the boundaries of believability far more than any one movie can withhold.
0," Patton, who excels at projecting confidence and cool, can't seem to get a handle on the movie's insecure heroine, and overcompensates with broadly cartoonish gestures and facial contortions."
0," In trying to create a modern horror take on Mean Girls (2004), in which the protagonists redefine their rivalries through physical instead of verbal viciousness, she has merely delivered an updated, dumbed-down rehash of Carrie (1976). "
0," By failing to mine deeper emotional and psychological territory, this exorcism flick never fully possesses its audience."
0," A few perceptive moments from the film will remain with me, but I suspect it'll be more in the language of unrelated memories; I wouldn't know where to place them, or why they appeal to me in a particular context. "
1," Colter, like Deckard before him, has to accept who and where he is, even as these definitions recede before him."
1," It's not a great monster movie. But if you've paid a matinee price and bought a big tub of popcorn, there's guilty fun to be had here. Chomp chomp!"

0," It's by turns maddening and beautiful, passive and provocative. "
0," Appealing not to the lowest common denominator but the shortest, i.e., the toddler set, barred due to the R rating. Or, as one young lad said to his friend in the sandbox: ""Waaaaaah!"""
1," Apted's subjects would object to the idea that we really know them, but we think we do -- and that's good enough to make his film feel like a reunion, a visit with an old friend. Or 14 of them."
0," Looks to smear massage oils across the screen, offering viewers something warm and cuddly despite a story that all but demands a more forthright recollection of mental and marital obstacles. "
0, Provides all the hallucinogenic benefits of an LSD trip without any of the nasty side-effects
0," Silliness is almost a prerequisite of horror films, of course, but when they are sillier than they are scary, then they have to be marked down as a fail."
0," Overly deliberate, quite preposterous thriller."
1," Sirk immediately and deliberately acknowledges the film's metaphoric, almost pathological obsession with surfaces."
0," On one level, it's unfair to penalize a pretty decent movie for not being a great movie, but then again, Fey has proved time and time again that she can do better than this."
1, A big gob of mythical makeover and special effects-freewheeling fun.
1, Studio Ghibli's adaptation of Arrietty's tale feels oddly traditional.
0," Dogs and cats are far funnier and more engaging when they behave like, well, dogs and cats."
0, A documentary would have been the best way to go with this material.
0, It is a little difficult to generate dramatic tension about an art-salvage project when there is a world war going on around it.
1," Of all the performances, Samuel L. Jackson's is the most surprising. It sometimes appears that the busy Jackson will take almost any role to stay working. This film provides a reminder of his subtlety."
0," I didn't think Diaz could be humiliated more than she was in ""Knight and Day,"" drugged and shipped as luggage, but I was wrong."
1, This suspenseful drama authentically reconstructs a disastrous rescue mission during the Afghan conflict.
0," Finally, a cast of high school students approved by AARP."
1," Paul Giamatti, dialing down his trembly-voiced neurotic energy to good effect, gives a holy hell of a performance..."

0," Almost everything in the film feels either forced or false, so the tears aren't earned."
0," If (and only if) you need to know every detail about how the Russian version of ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" was put together, drop everything to see ""Exporting Raymond."""
0," It's fine that the makeshift trilogy (please, let it only be a trilogy) is a simple-minded ode to love meant to send everyone home happy. So why doesn't it actually send anyone home happy?"
0," The scenes between Hopkins and Gosling stand out in what is generally a bland, by-the-books crime drama that drags when Hopkins isn't on screen."
1," Like it or not, The Voices aligns us with a murderer."
0," Classic scenes from Rashomon, The Seven Samurai, Throne of Blood, and Yojimbo are shown, but many of Kurosawa's finest with Mifune are skipped over entirely, including two majestic noirs, Stray Dog and High and Low."
1," It's comforting, really, to see the movie's soft-pedaling of actual ghetto problems; realism isn't Lottery Ticket's game."

0, The movie stinks.
0," The ham-handed director was Susanna White, who intercuts compulsively, whether or not anything is happening."
0," Action movies don't have to be believable or poignant. They just have to get your adrenaline pumping. But the movie lacks inspiration in that department, too ..."
0," It's the film's action scenes that are most disappointing, and made me feel like I was inside a video game."
1," (...) Un film colectivo irregular, con segmentos olvidables, otros muy bizarros, y algunos realmente sorprendentes."
0," The new film does little more than reintroduce these familiar characters (with new actors playing the children, who would otherwise be college age by now) and let them get on one another's nerves in earnest."
1, A film of rare power and tension in this subgenre and a farewell to the measure of that iconic character called Wolverine. [Full review in Spanish]
1," ...has a bit of fizz, if not quite as much as we might want."
1," A cold, majestic motion picture, a movie that seeks to remind us of the vastness of space and our relatively insignificant place in it."
0, the very human longing for roots [and] how preconceived notions about other cultures are a recipe for disaster . . .deserve better than the cheapening melodrama afforded them
0, This uneven screwball comedy -- a disjointed and half-hearted attempt by the Coen brothers to return to the Raising Arizona style -- is bound to underwhelm even their most fervent admirers.
1, The point of this true-life adventure is not the dissemination of information but the instilling of a sense of awe in the viewer ...
0," Much as I would like to give Penelope unreserved praise, I can't stretch my lukewarm approbation that far."
0, Downey's Hank is basically Downey playing a character carefully calibrated for audience sympathies -- hey he's a smug jerk of a lawyer but he's a really good Dad to his loving young daughter.
1," I find myself reflecting not upon the hilarity (of which there is more than enough here), but upon how desperately sad so much of the film is behind the booze and boob jokes."
1, Classic based on the Pulitzer prize-winning play.
1," Director Rupert Goold keeps things appropriately creepy, but True Story is no Capote."
0," As written and directed by Kelly Fremon Craig, the characters don't exist beyond their few foregrounded traits, and the action unspools mainly in clattery witticisms that take the place of substantial dialogue."
1," It's all ripe for standard Hollywood mockery, but director John Lee Hancock doesn't quite play it that way."
0, Concussion is a clumsy drama for its resistance to address deep into the issue it sets. [Full Review in spanish]
0," ...Spanglish is a sometimes entertaining, sometimes poignant, but more often than not, clichï¿½ï¿½-ridden drama/comed"
0," Pain, it turns out, can be unbearably dull."
0, It's taken three years for this negligible Aussie splatterfest to get its one-weekend-only release; you wonder why anybody thought to rescue it.
1," It illogically breezes by, even if much of the story shows our heroes doing little but hiding, fighting, and strategizing. "
0," I wonder what those MPAA members who gave this a PG-13 were smoking. Filled with crude, raunchy sexual references, it should have been R-rated."
0," A dopey, dull, depressingly inert sci-fi disaster that retains all of the benchmarks of Meyer's mediocrity (the weird politics, the staid plotting, the moony eyes) but somehow manages to be even more humiliatingly awful."
0," As things build toward the long, bloody and by-the-numbers (if ably staged) showdown, it's hard not to mourn for the film this could have been, considering the assemblage of talent."
1," In a way, Flying Daggers might be compared to the great old MGM musicals that were driven in part by showy set pieces."
0," Hitman may represent some progress in the video game adaptation genre, but it's not enough to recommend."
1," Despite its lack of originality, as well as its lackadaisical storytelling and world building, it satisfies in that amiably weird way that only a Cars film can."
1, Charming documentary on monastic existence.
1, The movie itself makes no judgment. It's smart enough to ask you to do that by yourself and for yourself.
0, Minimalist day in the life of the angry young leaves us wondering.
0," Eventually, inevitably, [it] goes too far, too fast, and ends up off the rails."
0," Why did Soderbergh want to remake an old film noir, anyway? Take out the crime elements and flesh out the human elements here, and you have a more interesting movie, I think."
0," The comedy is at times spot-on, but those moments can't beat the bloat."
1," If you only ever watch one Van Damme movie, it has to be JCVD."
1," Matt Damon and Paul Greengrass have created a fiery, quick-witted film that presents compelling evidence that the action-suspense genre has been ""Bourne again."""
0," Look, if you enjoyed the previous installments, you'll like this one too; it's designed to be precisely the same experience. This is not an endorsement."
1, This is what movies can be like if you try. 
0," It is handsomely crafted, to be sure, but boasts little authenticity and zero credibility."
1," The life blood of The Miseducation of Cameron Post is compassionate towards its subjects, evidently a reflection of Akhavan and Danford's being. "
0, The two-hour running time drags as this Spielberg misfire winds up being uninspiring and tedious.
1, The film focuses on the extreme limits of human fallibility and a true story that is so exceedingly unbelievable that it feels like it cannot possibly be true -- but it is.
0," It's a silly comedy with some real laughs, I'll give it that, but it's hardly the genre-bending, explosive, unpredictable work we're used to from Anderson."
0," For all its basis in real-world events, Pizzo's scenario - adapted from the book ""Courage Beyond the Game: The Freddie Steinmark Story"" by Jim Dent - plays like thoroughly predictable, by-the-numbers fiction."
0," This is truly terrible: a cost-cutting British action thriller with clunky script, wooden acting, uncertain directing, cheapo-looking interiors and the most outrageously obvious and rubbish ""twist"" reveal at the end."
1," Holy Rollers' innocence-lost, you-can't-go-home-again arc is something of a clichï¿½ï¿½, but the film remains re1ingly nonjudgmental about its hero's burgeoning criminal care"
1," Barney's Version starts fumblingly in picaresque mode, and only really hits its narrative and emotional stride in its second half."
0," This pumped-up contrived, misogynistic military murder mystery is just about the tackiest excuse for summer entertainment I've ever seen!"
1," ""Wetlands"" has a furrowed brow, and Valle is completely committed to negative energy, which might win over some viewers. "
1, A dank and dour drama contrasting the woes of a sad sack loser to the triumphs of an ambitious and self-confident winner.
0, A striking ineptitude of pacing and motivation. 
0," More of the same from Cera, and not terribly funny to boot."
1," See Titanic, then, for its success as an outrageous visual stunt -- a marvel of cinematic (and computer) sleight-of-hand. But don't go with any illusions that this soap opera on water is anything but a cartoon melodrama with fairy-tale leads."
1," This is a film that might clot from the pressure of too much unlikely, writerly detail if not for the elbow grease applied by its two charming stars..."
1, This documentary is a chronicle of a life lived as well as a celebration of American music.
1," Natalie Portman dramatically interprets this ""black swan"" of pop within this dark portrait of the price of fame. [Full Review in Spanish]"
1," ...a Get Smart for the big screen: a feature length spy spoof with up-to-date gags, some thrilling stunts, and a top-notch cast."
1," The tension is in the buildup... and the payoff is in the ugliness, both physical and emotional."
1," There's not an ounce of fat on the film. It feels like it moves forward in every single scene, and while it's a little mechanical about how it follows three-act structure, it's almost charmingly old-fashioned about it."
0," There are swords and sorcery, pirates and monsters, taxed bodices and taxing mythology. In other words, there's the bare minimum necessary to summon this dismal movie into existence."
1, A 'Stupid Comedy' that gleefully celebrates the absurd and actually trusts its audience to be smart.
1, A worthy introduction to a familiar yet still extraordinary universe that hedges its risks to reach a teenage demographic but still teases more than enough potential.
0, Shaye is great. But how many times will dopes pay to see the same film?
0," Kusama has the chops to fulfill the ambitions of this undertaking, but even her savvy can't justify the conflated, white-light ending that's disproportionately out of whack with everything before it."
1, An absolutely absorbing finale which establishes the trilogy as perhaps the best mythic fable ever brought to the big screen.
0," It's just a little underdeveloped. Perhaps in novel form its polite pace and subtle revelations made a certain amount of sense, but the movie is lacking."
1, There's a sublimely goofy tone to this profoundly inept film that keeps us smiling from start to finish
0, What could have been a companion piece to The Conjuring is instead a yawn-inducing show.
0," when the entire movie revolves around rooting for (or against) the success of a massive suicide bombing campaign, you're asking a lot from the popcorn and nacho crowd."
0," We are regaled with the spectacle of sparky girl characters, who are aimed squarely at an impressionable tween girl audience, walking about in the sorts of high-fashion outfits you normally see on a catwalk or in the bar of a five-star hotel."
0, An extraordinary bore.
1," Brando pulls off astonishing things as Stanley Kowalski, and Vivien Leigh gives a performance that must have taken everything she had as Blanche DuBois."
0," It's shorter than the first, marginally less gruesome and violent, but appreciably more implausible and absurd..."
0, An aggressively obnoxious true story of young arms dealers bottom-feeding off the Pentagon.
1," Like many holiday locations, you wouldn't want to live there, but a mini-break from the norm can be a real tonic."
1," The film is resonant and largely satisfying, but in a smaller, more cerebral way than many of its genre."
0," Only a first-rate cast -- headed by Jake Gyllenhaal, and made memorable by the performances of Jamie Foxx and Peter Sarsgaard -- saves Jarhead from looking like a dead duck, covered in oil."
1," A moving, ravishing, heartbreaking ode to the Mexico... This is a film so sincere and beautiful that, ideally, it deserves to be seen on the cinema screen. How about that, Netflix? "
1," The picture, just about as surreal as David Lynch on his quirkiest day, is at once staggering, baffling, morose, frightening, hilarious, continuously inventive, and unspeakably touching."
1, An irresistibly engaging documentary that might be described as a lab experiment in art history presented with Las Vegas-style showmanship.
0," Like the small farmers forced to kowtow to corporations, writer and director Ramin Bahrani chickens out. His melodramatic script reduces a global conflict to a Grain Belt ""Glengarry Glen Ross."""
0," Domhnall Gleeson and Margot Robbie make it entirely watchable, but the lack of complicated emotions means it's also completely forgettable."
1," The Polleys are so charming and down-to-earth, and their pain so tangible, it's an absolute heart-breaker."
1," It has a solid grounding in the series, and a respect for the people who made and love it."
0," Like a dream, an advertisement or a music video, it simply isn't built to withstand the pressure of logical scrutiny."
0, The lighting was so off in this movie that bright patches of sunlight made me squint and dark nighttime scenes lost some character's facial features.
0, Only intermittently engaging and too timid to be satisfactorily funny or insightful.
0, It's all so lamely poetic.
0," I don't care if it's 2-D, 3-D, CGI or hand drawn, it all goes back to the story."
0," The theme here is solid...and Kazan plays every rewritten aspect nicely. But I'm sorry, movie; would you mind giving us even a token explanation of why this fictional character came to be?"
0," The writing is abysmal, the acting wouldn't pass muster in a high school play, and the direction by erstwhile stuntman Steve Boyum (Timecop: The Berlin Decision) is positively sleep-inducing between cycle jumps."
1," Taking its cue from Ruth, On the Basis of Sex includes everyone in the equation. Mothers - and fathers! - should take their brainy kids to see it."
0," Kaos was apparently aiming for a coolly stylized, straight-faced take on Spy vs. Spy. As Maxwell Smart used to say, 'Missed it by that much.'"
1, The acting is all solid and the message is heartfelt. It's a movie that reminds us to be grateful for man's best friend
1," The interesting thing about the film is the absence of loud, black or white speeches that hide the gray continuum of late adolescence. [Full review in Spanish]"
1, Susan Sarandon gets to shine in her best screen outing in some time.
1," Reaches its apex with a manic party scene that unleashes the full intimidation of P. Diddy and guarantees the phrase ""stroke the furry wall"" a place in the comedy lexicon..."
1," The contradictory goals of the film seem fitting, given the nature of Narcissister's art, and she reconciles them well."
0," The laughs don't linger, even within individual scenes. What remains, reinforced by a set of end-credit outtakes, is the sense that Sudeikis, Day, Bateman, and Pine had a really good time making a sort of okay movie."
1, The Belko Experiment gives audiences a delightful amount of carnage and mayhem in a humorous office setting.
0, There's shockingly little plot in this tale of the denizens of the titular city.
1," It would take a pretty good filmmaker to turn Grandma's old home movies and audio tapes into something mysterious and chilling, but Morgan Dews has done that with this provocative documentary."
0," Liz figures she needs to spend some time with no one but herself. Speaking as one who has spent 140 minutes with her, I would advise against that. "
0," Worst of all is the gore, of which there really isn't any... that rare horror film that has a body count of zero."
1," Happy Endings begins with what seems quite an unhappy ending, when Mamie (Lisa Kudrow) is hit by a car."
0," With its undeveloped premise and juvenile humor, Grown Ups remains emotionally and comedically stunted."
0, Blandly wishy-washy.
0, There is beauty to which this movie is stone cold blind: beauty it tramples on as ignorantly as Buddy Kane or Col. Fitts.
1," Valuing logic over brutality, David Fincher's claustrophobic ride also touted the real-world practicality of keeping quiet over the cinematic kicks of a loud thriller. It's like ""Wait Until Dark"" with helplessness that's emotional, not just physical."
0," The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" is a movie title that reviews itself."
0, Demonstrating that something darker lurks beneath the surface isn't as profound as the film seems to think
1," There are lots of mysterious images you want the characters to investigate, even though you know the results will be scary."
0," If you're going to adapt Stephen King's eight-book opus ... why would you turn its lead character, Roland Deschain, aka the Gunslinger (Idris Elba), into a supporting character?"
1," Combining elements of sweepingly romantic time travel movies like Somewhere In Time and the supernatural swoon of Ghost, this first-rate and spellbinding drama is out to prove true love can overcome any obstacle-in this world or the next."
1," Fiennes has seldom been better, but then has he ever been bad? He's indeed our Montgomery Clift for this new millennium: sensitive, moral, and yet strong."
1," Clooney is remarkable in Alexander Payne's film about loss, confusion and getting by."
1," Ghost Town"" is given a bit of bite by Gervais... It's not destined to be a classic, but it is one that will make you laugh..."
0," Splinters has the makings of a bedroom farce, but it is actually played, um, straight."
1," A wonderfully vital, illuminating study of the New York of 20-plus years ago."
1, Gunn keeps the action moving at a pace that's sometimes exhausting but amidst all the explosions and the crashing spaceships and exploding cityscapes there's usually room for a quick quip or laugh-out-loud gag.
1, Picture Commando as a psychological thriller. Imagine Halloween as a theme park ride. Think Drive as a comedy.
1," Things get a little shaky once the facts are known, but everything speeds along smoothly while it's still ""Unknown."""
0, This isn't Sin-bad. It is just Sin- mediocre.
0," Not that the characters matter, because the screenwriters and director Stephen Sommers are determined to mainly deliver one high-octane, heavily CGI-laden action set piece after another, to ultimately deadening effect."
1," To the Wonder feels like a caricature coveting Malick's previously towering pieces of visual art. However there's more refined, contemplative poetry in this relative misstep than in a hundred Hollywood studio films. "
0," Soon, the stylistic flourishes don't just seem self-conscious but cribbed, karaoke shades of Nuri Bilge Ceylan and Harmony Korine."
0," One of these days, I hope I respond to a Joe Swanberg movie the way some do."
0," The best thing on display here is the cast, which includes Cillian Murphy, Armie Hammer, Sharlto Copley and Brie Larson. But despite their best efforts, Wheatley continues to be hamstrung by his love of gore and general excess."
1," Hart is played in the film by Hugh Jackman, or, rather, by a brave dialectical struggle between the actor and his wig. By a hair's breadth, the actor wins."
1," Starred Up director David Mackenzie helms with muscle and panache, in both bracing action scenes and quieter moments of introspection, all framed gorgeously by cinematographer Giles Nuttgens."
1," Led by a standout performance from Elle Fanning as a musical sensation, Teen Spirit is a crowd-pleasing directorial debut forMax Minghella."
1," Scrooged is, indeed, phenomenally loud, and also very mean, and somehow also ultimately heartening, in a loopy yuletide sort of way. "
1," Whatever else you think, you'll have to admit you have never before seen anything quite like this one."
1," Close's performance as this poor, wounded fellow resonates with depth and poignancy."
1," Wisecracking their way through tough situations and bickering like an old married couple, Hines and Crystal succeed in creating a new buddy team that ranks with the likes of Robert Redford and Paul Newman."
1," Judged on its own terms, A Wrinkle in Time is a pretty good, perhaps even a quite good, movie. But it is a children's movie. See it with a child or--as DuVernay recommends--with a child's wonder. Otherwise, probably don't bother seeing it at all."
0, The theatre will be so fertile with romance that it could pollinate a bouquet of roses.
0," The camera-eye view is treated more as an obstacle to be overcome than a tool for storytelling, raising the question of why not just scrap it altogether."
0, So elementary it makes most after-school specials look sophisticated.
0," Most successful is the chemistry between Grace and Hathaway, but with so many swings, that's a pretty low batting average."
1," Gilliam's latest, with a script by first-time screenwriter Pat Rushin, may in fact be about an insane man in a differently insane reality. This makes it a difficult story to grasp, but a wild ride if you can manage to hold on."
0," I like this character, and Kenny is a ""character"" in every sense of the word. The trouble is that Kenny is the film's only character that is truly fleshed out."
0, Not even the genius of Carmen Machi manages to save this... [Full review in Spanish]
1," Generation Wealth is a symphony playing only one basic tune. But there are a lot of instruments, and some sprightly, if wayward and opportunistic, variations on the theme."
1, The best part of the movie is watching Gervais and Leoni delight in each other in scenes that burst with spontaneity and genuine warmth.
0, There are flashes of potential here ... but Sex Tape possesses too much comedic insecurity to do anything of value with them.
1, As a spoof of a spoof the picture becomes repetitive and tiresome in spots but remains entertaining enough to deserve a visit.
0, The morphing teenage misfits don't stand a chance against the cliche-ridden script and clunky direction.
0," Only David Cross, as arch-enemy Ian Hawke, manages to wring a few laughs from the sodden script, but for those you have to listen to such Chipmunk teen speak as ""totally adorbs"" for 90 minutes."
1, It never fails to engage us.
0," Teenagers, as well as the rest of the audience, really don't need to insulted."
0, A soap opera that takes itself far too seriously at all times.
0, There is not a trace of human emotion in it. To call the characters cardboard is to insult a useful packing material.
1, It also roams an exalted plane of entertainment few blockbusters ever reach: crafting fare of a fine calibre that satisfies thrill seekers and deep thinkers alike.
0," Paul Hogan, Elijah Wood, and a dolphin. There, I just saved you 97 minutes."
1," ""Jackie"" shows us how Kennedy gave birth to the legend of the modern-day Camelot, but it also captures the ongoing evolution of a star, right before our eyes."
0," Unsure what it wants to say, Kick-Ass 2 is a forgettable action flick with just an occasional splattering of humour."
1," There are no easy heroes or foils in this briskly cross-cutting ensemble piece, only blossoming adults and beleagured elders ..."
1," This 'RoboCop' spends more time developing the man behind the machine, making him more complex and less detached (at least, at first)."
1, Reid -- like the Katharine Hepburn of Summertime and Brigitte Mira of Fassbinder's Fear Eats the Soul -- transforms herself before our very eyes.
0," Despite Cate Blanchett's and Robert Redford's earnest work, the truth about ""Truth"" is that it fails to engage on the emotional and intellectual levels that would have made it commanding drama. "
1," ...likely to engender inspiration amidst the pews, as this biopic about the church reformer is so obviously designed to do."
0, The film almost completely falls apart in the second half when it becomes as loud as it is tedious.
1, District B13 speaks the international language of brilliantly choreographed mayhem ... and could be the action movie to beat this year; we'll see if any other director comes close to equaling its delirious rush. The picture is 85 minutes long and
0," It is profoundly unpleasant and, unfortunately, part of a trilogy."
1, An hilarious mining of the comic book hero's history.
0," How the filmmakers managed to line up an A-list cast is baffling, because they've been handed the Lamest. Gags. Ever."
0, An off-the-map disaster...the New Orleans of 2005 movies.
0," Not only plays like the crassest possible mashup of ""Harry Potter"" and ""Twilight"" elements, but seems designed to make those franchises look like eternal monuments of world culture by comparison."
0, ...I got the distinct impression the actors were bored as well.
0," I'm not sure I'd call it classic Raimi horror, because I think his very first films, the Evil Dead films, were quite a lot better than this. I just didn't really think it worked on the visceral horror level that he does so well at his best."
0," [It] makes a huge mistake when it proceeds as if we care equally about the dozen or so characters from the ""Pie"" movies. They're all back, even the ones played by those bad actors, and they all have subplots in ""Reunion."""
1," A manic, light-hearted comedy about a nice young criminal who uses time-travel paradoxes to create a gang of himself (himselves?)... Absurd, childish, petty, seemingly dumb but actually clever."
1," The film is light and follows a distinct formula, but Walsh is incredibly charming, and shares a potent chemistry with Godrï¿½ï¿½"
1, A thoroughly competent movie that is reasonably effective at being what it sets out to be -- a solid little thriller. It's also pretty hard to get excited about.
0," Ultimately, it's hard to figure out exactly what movie Anvari was trying to make. "
0," It has its moments, but mostly it feels like being stuck in the backseat on a long car ride."
1," As blockbusters go, Revenge of the Sith has some good throwaway entertainment, but there have been better blockbusters with better throwaway entertainment."
1," Still together, and still in love"
0," While producers Fox Walden continue in their efforts to bring interesting books for youngsters to the big screen, moviegoers are advised to read the novel and skip the flick."
1," ""Finding Neverland"" is full of wit, emotion, adventure, and mystery that will inspire all ages to come see why and how Peter Pan was born."
0, A worn-out gross-out.
0," Whilst it suffers from a lack of focus at times, it's a well-made and thought-provoking insight into our strange new world."
0," Mr. Kent somberly wanders the Midwest, pondering the struggles of being an incredibly handsome alien with perfect hair, steel pecs and a natural six pack. The film struggles, never finding the balance of action and the 'deep' storyline."
0, The movie wimped out by blanding down the story and the characters to the point where she isn't really a shrew and he isn't really a maniac.
1," An ingenious first film made on a budget of about $7,000 by a former engineer and self-taught filmmaker about the perils of ingenuity."
0," It could've been a more intense and intelligent product. I can only recommend it to the fans of the saga, or those who want to have fun with a brief and cheesy adventure. [Full review in Spanish]"
0," Russell should probably be applauded for trying something different, but I Heart Huckabees often seems weird for weirdness' sake."
0," Even though the film's tagline confidently calls him ""the ultimate bachelor,"" Sandler doesn't walk the walk, and Segal isn't enough of a director to sell it."
1, Delivers plenty of decent laughs in its short running time.
0," Malmberg's video imagery, captured by point-and-shoot camerawork, and livened up with big band music from time to time, can't hold a candle to outsider artist Mark Hogancamp's work."
1," Conventional, fairly exciting stuff, its most distinctive feature perhaps is the realistic, atmospheric photography by Ken Loach's regular collaborator, Barry Ackroyd."
0, All this less-than-ideal Husband proves is there are few folks who have the sense to leave classic text alone.
0," Maybe if I watched it again, Dead Men would make more sense, but here's the thing: I didn't get Curse of the Black Pearl all in one go either, but I knew I wanted to watch it again."
1," A gritty low-budget mix of some of the best bits from Mad Max, Outbreak and Night Of The Living Dead, it ticks all the boxes in a re1ingly snappy 84 minute runtime."
1," There's a germ of something genuine under all the imitation, and the movie works, despite itself."
1, A film with the humble intention to move with something tangible and valuable as can be the simple goal of seeking the common good. [Full review in Spanish]
1, [T]he film's intricate plot begins to collapse the moment the lights come up and you begin thinking about the story.
0," Apparently it's meant to be taken seriously, even as the scowling villain wears an eye patch."
1, Spanish-language romcom's mature themes may not translate.
0," In his never-ending quest to go beyond the impossible, Bay has actually succeeded but not at all in the way he probably hoped. Miraculously, against all odds, Michael Bay has made a movie about giant robots invading the earth... boring."
0," Much like a William S. Burroughs novel, the film could be cut up and reassembled and make just as much sense."
1, Spaceballs meets the Six Clueless Samurai.
0," It's got solid roots, but a painfully weak life-to-book-to-film transition turns an extraordinary story into something that's not only forgettable, but hard to remember, too."
1," Payne's script has a tendency to meander (making room for plenty of cameos), and Downsizing is overlong, but the world it creates is so simultaneously fascinating and horrifying that you don't mind spending some more time there."
0," In one scene of ""Trash Humpers,"" the camera lingers on an abandoned toilet in the middle of a field, as voices cackle off-camera. The filmography of Harmony Korine, ladies and gentlemen!"
0," [Glenn Close] does an exemplary job of giving a surface-level performance, which is the kind of praise that no matter how generously it is meant, just won't come out sounding like a compliment."
0," It is trying very hard not to say anything real one way or another, but it's not amusing enough to distract us from the script, and the script is trying so hard to be noncommittal that it can't fall back on substance either. "
1," A smidge more commercial than Jarmusch's meandering previous effort, ""The Limits of Control."" But it still feels like an in-joke intended only for select acolytes, who will probably love it with an undying passion."
1, It's a tribute to Fincher and Sorkin that The Social Network ends up being more absorbing and nuanced than anyone could have hoped.
1," Even when the laughs are less frequent, they continue through to the end, with plenty of quotable lines."
0, The sexual outbursts in the film are tempered with a tenderness that one hardly associates with Bruce LaBruce's career.
0, It takes two bad genres -- live-action Disney dreck and lowest-common-denominator Sandler humor -- and blends them into one unfunny mess.
0," Freeheld is ultimately a film without a soul, without character; full of clichï¿½ï¿½s to a genre that simply does not need them. [Full review in Span"
0," Like all good food porn, the story here is wafer-thin at best."
1," It's a lot more candid, at least verbally, than most American rom coms are these days and I like that about it. I liked its cheekiness of dialogue."
0, Horror-ifically bad.
0," The film's maritime setting has a certain aptness because Serenity has all the hallmarks of a fish tale. Unfortunately, Knight lets this one get away."
0," The familiarity wouldn't matter if the gags weren't so belabored and, thanks to the PG-13 rating, neutered."
0," Hawke gives his all here -- or maybe just half his all -- and it isn't quite enough: He's trying to be soulful, but he really just looks a little tired. The real delight is Willem Dafoe."
0," Production designer Jeffrey Beecroft (""Transformers: Age of Extinction"") has recreated the two American outposts, but spatial integrity isn't always the film's strong suit."
0," My suggestion after the fact would have been to re-release 1981's 'Clash of the Titans,' reprocessed in 3D, and forget about any remake. Forget this remake, for sure."
1, Offbeat relationship between a Senegalese cab driver and a suicidal Southerner makes for an interesting character study.
1," even when it's slumming in sentimentality, it never offers you exactly what you're expecting, and that is admirable. "
1," Within its first five minutes, ""The Double"" insists upon its bona fides with a will and makes you like it."
0," A sprawling, deformed, undisciplined piece of cinema that hobbles along on weak, genre-splicing tactics."
0, An embarrassment to Universal's horror legacy.
0," Evans lacks the lasting charismatic presence for this kind of role, but works hard to ground every silly moment he's given with turbulent gravity."
1, An odd yet fascinating extension to [Cormac McCarthy's] violent literary oeuvre.
0, Carpenter should stick to what he's good at-scaring folks-and leave the political satire to Spitting Image.
1, Blindness is a compelling and faithful adaptation of the novel by Nobel Prize-winning author Jose Saramango.
0," Since the story is essentially Anne Frank re-gendered, why bother at all?"
0," The film's own miracle is that the mid-film shift yields only a minimum of TBN-style kitsch, but it also robs the second half of any forward drive."
0," Jacquot's rendering of Puccini's tale of devotion and double-cross is more than just a filmed opera. In his first stab at the form, Jacquot takes a slightly anarchic approach that works only sporadically."
1," Director Kelly Reichardt, who made the great ""Wendy and Lucy,"" likes stories that unfold slowly and simply. Sometimes she'll just let the camera run, making us watch the awkwardness of people who can't connect."
0," Compared to a genuinely rousing gay-rights historical drama like Milk (2008), Stonewall falls considerably short. "
0," A well-intentioned exercise in humanism... but as art or a successful narrative, the movie is ultimately empty."
0, Save your money and download the screensaver.
0," With the classic magician's tactic of misdirection, Now You See Me gets us to look at all the explosions, car crashes and pretty people while concealing that the magician's hat is empty and his cards are clearly marked."
0," There's nothing here that hasn't been seen in dozens of other crime films. We don't care for the main character because all that we know about him, which isn't much, is bad."
1, This is a better story than the platitude that it seems to build up to in the final scene. But it was not all the film it could have been if Zemeckis would have realized where his best material lay.
1," The movie's perfectly understated, warts-and-all sense of time and place will send any suburban Gen Xer in the audience flashing right back to their less-cautious days, when mix tapes did heavy lifting as calling cards."
1, Our Idiot Brother kept me laughing throughout.
0," Days after seeing The Artist, I find it hard to place any individual moments that resonated (aside from the doggie heroism) and I suspect that, title aside, the movie feels a complacent cynicism toward art."
1, The Witnesses has an emotional maturity that adds richness to its social observation.
0," With style and content failing to gel, A Second Chance may just go to prove that Bier and Jensen aren't the perfect match they'd have us believe."
0," Measured performances from the leading triumvirate of LaBeouf, Hardy and Pearce wet the whistle but there's no long finish."
0," I don't believe for a minute that this is a woman who hasn't already come of age, found her voice, and talked a sensitive singer-songwriter into hiring her to star in his movie. "
0," In reaching for tragic grandeur and psychological complexity, the movie takes on a lot of baggage that it can't quite carry."
0, You should be able to quash this one with no cravings to ever pick it up again.
0, The only truly scary thing about this film is that it runs out of narrative steam with 30 or 40 interminable minutes still to go.
1," If you're looking for a more unique and potentially ambiguous look at an out-of-the-ordinary relationship - with some wry social commentary on internet fandom - Juliet, Naked is a lot of fun."
0," ...here's the answer to the biggest question you'll have after the movie is over: no, you can't get your money back."
1," About Schmidt is a curious slice of Americana...the characters are so clearly drawn and the dialogue so rich, you are immediately hooked."
0," The actors all grit teeth, chew mouthfuls of mushy cornpone and attempt to make something of this, despite a cheese-ball script and pretty perfunctory direction, both by Shana Feste."
0, At least he's not flinging vomit at anybody...
0," Bad enough the butler actually did it - have the butler wipe the victim's blood on the stumped inspector's face, & confess for 10 minutes.."
0," It's no ""Raging Bull."" "
1," There is nothing new or ambitious about Yes Man. It is intended to be a textbook Jim Carrey silly comedy, and honestly, that's just fine by me."
1, Agatha Christie's 1934 Hercule Poirot novel has been filmed for the first time in a bygone film style as it seems to be some treasure out of a time capsule.
0," [Randle] holds the film together as best she can with her luminous presence and dignity, but can't supply the lacking subtext, past history and motivation."
1," The second teaming of Diablo Cody and Reitman, a serio comic fable about the maturation of a delusional femme, is elevated considerably by Charlize Theron's full-bodied, multi-nuanced, Oscar-caliber performance."
0," Not only does Stigmata revel in anti-Vatican jabs that will offend religious-minded people, it goes over the top with its bloody Exorcist-style story."
0, Even The Doors looked like a model of clarity next to this.
1, Three Kings manages to venture into places that most American films never go.
0," Adam Sandler, reigning king of the Filmed Vacation, is back for another luxurious trip short on belly laughs and long on gooey sentimentality and familiar slapstick."
1," The year's most captivating narrative experiment, and possibly the most engrossing coming-of-age movie in the history of the genre."
0," Katti Batti is a film that tries too hard to be ""cool"" and ends up falling on its face."
0," Perfume is ultimately an unmistakable failure, but there's a strange majesty to its epic overreaching."
1," Doubt brings assumptions about people and circumstances to the surface, and then challenges those assumptions with uncertainty and, yes, doubt. Nobody loses, but nobody wins, either"
0," If we don't care about the characters or what they're playing for, then we've no reason to root for them."
1," Anonymous may not convince anyone, but it certainly should entertain them."
0, An absolutely disastrous piece of work...
1," Has the same propulsive, punk-rock vibe as Trainspotting and 24 Hour Party People."
0, A huge disappointment and a wasted opportunity. [Full review in Spanish]
1," This is Werner Herzog at his best -- a cynic with a big heart, and a nasty wit."
0," Mary Poppins Returns serves too many cultural and financial masters to be its own beast, so it's forced to make space in a middle ground circumscribed by nostalgia."
1, A narrative shapeshifter that gleefully toys with its audience's perception of love and themselves.
0, This is kind of a terrible movie with some really talented people.
1," It takes real skill to make a film about a desperate Syrian refugee and a dour middle-aged Finn reinventing himself and turn it into the warmest, most life-enhancing film I've seen this year."
0," A cautionary tale with one exclamation mark too many, The Rules of Attraction simply tries too hard."
0, Avoid this drivel at all costs.
0, long and cumbersome
1, The movie franchise based on J.K. Rowlings' novels gets its The Empire Strikes Back moment. It's a downbeat cliffhanger that suggests its central characters are exiting their age of innocence.
1, The best of Woody Allen.
1, The film isn't easy to classify-it's a psychodrama that occasionally sharpens into blood-curdling horror-but the experience of watching it is deeply unsettling .
1, A taught and tight thinking man's thriller that packs in a healthy dose of social commentary into its compact running time.
0, ...a tremendously disappointing effort from a once rock-solid filmmaker.
1, The Citizen Kane of westerns.
1, Immensely powerful in its invocation of the true meaning of Christian charity and its symbolism.
0," Better than most ""found footage"" films, but still far from a good movie. [Full review in Spanish]"
0," ""An Acceptable Loss"" is truly a loss."
0," Fasten your seat belts, it's going to be a bumpy review."
1, ... a film brimming with honest sentiment and infused with the spirit of Frank Capra's best work.
0," There may once have been a charming idea at the heart of Bedtime Stories, but alas, whatever it might have been has been Sandler-ized. And not for your protection."
0, Live By Night is a disjointed mess.
0, Forget the hand-holding tweens in the audience - Twilight itself could use a chaperone.
0, There is no excuse for a movie being quite this lame and stupid.
1," A good old-fashioned horror in the best possible way, this is a beautifully told, terrifying ghost story that lingers with you long after the shivers have stopped."
0," What's troubling is its lack of perspective on anything beyond the narrow, navel-gazing concerns of its characters."
0," Flashes of wit and whimsy notwithstanding, the future is just as sentimentalized as the past."
1," Doesn't quite live up to [its] promise but ... it's mature, smart and engaging and, critically, strikes a new tone for Liman's work."
0, If you like Rowan Atkinson you will like the movie; if you don't then you won't. I am in the anti-Atkinson camp.
1," The kind of horror film that tells you exactly when to close your eyes, but it's fun nonetheless."
0," If there was a device that could measure the impact of jokes falling flat, this film would be an ideal test subject. "
0," The filmmakers set this all up beautifully, which only makes it more disappointing when the second half of the movie degenerates into cheesy courtroom theatrics and soap-bubbly melodrama."
1," An enchanting puzzle, not flashy, but fiendishly clever in the plotting and even more fiendish in the telling."
0," Queen is the sort of project which marketing teams like to talk about as ""classic"" while secretly knowing that it's just old-fashioned."
1, Marson puts the onus on her audience to look below the surface at the complexities of the case and the drug itself.
0," The movie feels stitched together and soldiered-on, with a heart-like-a-wheel coda that's not particularly well-executed, and is weirdly moving all the same."
0, The heavy-handedness -- the strip-search begins with the loud thwack of rubber gloves -- reduces Hamid's characters to talking points. 
0," [Nearly] works as a horror-tinged chamber drama; when it is about spooky, underlit houses with inexplicable goings-on... it's merely adequate at best, and frequently not even that."
0," Seems intent on mocking the first film, rather than paying respect to it and sewing a new narrative."
1, A spectacular adventure that keeps the heart of the story intact while making us have a good time. [Full review in Spanish]
1," It's an enjoyable snack, and the guests are good company and don't overstay their welcome during a mostly fun evening. "
1," Generally technically slick, briskly paced and painless to watch, assuming you're not the sort to squirm miserably at the sight of anatomical mayhem."
0," It's a wonder that a video game from the 1980s could efficiently set its premise up in a single cut scene, but a major Hollywood production in 2018 can't seem to get beyond mere exposition in its 107-minute running time."
0, Preaching to the choir and doing so in shorthand.
1," But if it doesn't exactly feel revelatory or deeply explored as a historical document, it's still an intriguing story, capably told."
1, Prepare for one of the most fun nights you're destined to have at the movies this year.
1," Against all odds, the movie becomes more than the sum of its creaky parts, building enough emotional firepower to destroy an entire hard-bitten cynic such as myself."
0," Sexual violence, cursing in strongly pro-vigilante drama."
1," Rush hits a few potholes, but in the end it reveals the psyches of two men who only feel alive when they're cheating death."
1," Good story, great visuals, and most important of all, this movie has heart."
0, The faux-Odyssean trials the characters face are also paradoxically so strained that they often look more arbitrary than thoughtful.
0," ...Anthropoid feels like it was shot for television, and none too well at that. "
0," If there existed an award for pointless, dreary and depressing movies, Biutiful would sweep the board."
1," The source material has been broadened with great respect and tenderness, while the illustrations that made the book so special have served as inspiration for some of the most beautiful computer-generated imagery ever."
0, Here's one that feels like homework.
0, The film goes flat quicker than an inflatable Wal-Mart pool toy.
0," A film where the resources of the cinema of catastrophes, martial arts and terror accumulate disorderly and confusingly. [Full review in Spanish]"
1," You'll likely forget the whole film in a heartbeat, but there are flickers of sincere emotion here - vital signs that show Advani can still assemble a functioning entertainment when he hasn't got the heavies round."
0, At least we now know why Anne Hathaway's co-presenting this year's Oscars. She's not gonna make it to that stage any other way.
0," To be fair, anthology films are almost always hit or miss, but this one features far more of the latter."
0," Heist goes from lousy to even worse. The screenplay is so clunky, not a single cast member manages to sound believable. Familiar, likable actors from Kate Bosworth to Gina Carano to Morris Chestnut are buried under an avalanche of awful."
0," The reveal is eye-rollingly bad, a moment of affected profundity Michod's long, winding road trip never earns."
1, Surprise and tension make this Korean police mystery a fun ride
1," You'll definitely regret it in the morning, and wonder what the hell you were thinking, but as hedonistic cinema trips go, Limitless's power to entertain - while it might not live up to its title - just about extends to its 105 minute running time."
1, The saving grace is not one but two mischievous turns by Michael Fassbender.
0," Hollywood, which spent most of the last century ignoring the black family, seems determined to spend most of this one showing the same black family. Over and over."
1," Ragnarok might not be the auteurist MCU film the world is (still) waiting for, but it hits a sweet spot between flashy adolescent fun and engaging characterization."
1," Immensely satisfying both visually and narratively, Bad Times at the El Royale plays like a kinetic mashup of Pulp Fiction and The Grand Budapest Hotel."
1," Both Scanlan and Fiennes are splendid performers, but this movie belongs to Felicity Jones."
0, What's that smell? The plain isn't the only thing that's charred in screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga's directorial debut; subtlety goes up in flames too.
1," The movie is entertaining and undeniably sexy, filled with an atmosphere charged by lust and desire."
0," In a parallel world, there is a version of this movie that is just as offensive, but also funny and smart. It's a pity we will never see it."
1," Bubble Boy is a strange, bizarre, twisted romantic comedy."
0," The minus I give this children's story pains me...If I had seen this film when I was eight, I would have been terrified. "
0, There's no possible mystery. [Full Review in Spanish]
0," Neither as funny as it thinks it is nor as tough to sit through as many other movies of this sort, 'Sydney' is custom-made for viewers who haven't taken their ACTs yet."
0, It's a poor show when a biopic can offer little to recommend its subject beyond her fame.
1, A film that defies the somewhat limited budget provided.
0, A stinker in every sense.
0," Directed by Paul Feig, who helmed ""Bridesmaids"", ""The Heat"" plays the tired FBI vs. local authorities card, as in, who has the jurisdiction? Feig cleary struck gold with ""Bridesmaids"". Unfortunately his magic touch is mostly uninspired here. "
0," The Lady in the Van is a delicate little piece, one that could so easily be overdone. Thankfully, Bennett, Hytner and, of course, the incomparable Dame Maggie refuse to turn the film into the expected Best Marigold Hotel mush."
1," It would've been easy for The Charmer to tell a simplistic story about an Iranian immigrant... Instead, The Charmer explores Esmail and Sara's differences, presenting a world where his code-switching never stops."
1," Mr. Dafoe turns in his best, most touching performance in years. "
1, One of those movies that work retrospectively: the final scene pulls the film together.
0," Dodge and Penny are too busy being quirky indie creations instead of human beings, too adrift in their own world to connect in any meaningful way with ours."
1," The staging of a few scenes suggests home-movie limitations. But enthusiasm counts for a great deal in a project as ambitious and strange as ""Second Nature."""
1," Not As Innovative As Everyone Wants to Give it Credit For, But Still An Interesting Blast."
1," 'The film is ... as rich in Depression-era authenticity as such a picture gets, complete with a palpable air of social decay and personalized despondency.'"
0," Runner Runner is elevated by solid performances but, for a story about gambling and striving for greatness, the film (ironically) takes very few risks."
1," Sisters is an old-school laugh riot, with a parade of talented comedians scoring here, there, and everywhere."
1," Buoyed by faultless actors who mesh beautifully, Miller's film tickles you with laughs that can - suddenly or even days later - choke you up with emotion. "
1, Greenaway deliver[s] his most enjoyable film in nearly thirty years.
1," Its premise, I'll admit, is a lot to ask moviegoers to swallow. But if you can go along with its tall-tale spirit, you can't help but be amazed at how ingeniously the filmmakers work out the ramifications of Betty's delusion."
0," This polite film, though touching in places, is so desperate not to offend, it's the film equivalent of sensible shoes."
1, Meryl Streep is superb and her character is simply larger than life. [Full review in Spanish]
0, [Pryce] is horribly let down by a predictable paint-by-numbers script and some overcooked supporting performances.
0, As far as the movie's message is considered -- if only grown-ups could be more like kids -- Jerry Lewis did an infinitely better job of plugging it in the 50s.
0," Even if the film isn't worth recommending, it's not nearly as bad as it deserves to be."
1, Never has a film captured the Biblical implications of the father-son relationship so well. Road to Perdition is beatiful on every level.
1," While the first Star Wars will always be a sentimental favorite, Attack of the Clones may well be the best in the series overall."
0," How can we, as a species, tolerate Jennifer Aniston with her blurry expression of emotional bravery?"
1, Haneke's challenge to audiences is to experience real love - it's tough and brutal and definitely not for the faint of heart.
0," What compelled Kapur to film half the movie through scrims, curtains, screens and arches? How can you appreciate human drama when you're constantly being distracted by the 16th-century equivalent of Architectural Digest?"
0," Something between an indiscretion and an atrocity, in the key of that most human yet loathsome of self-indulgences, vanity."
1, You're happy to follow this movie over the river and through the woods.
1," There's little new in terms of the plot's bold strokes. But the details and minutiae keep Irina Palm 1er than it would have been otherwise -- along with Faithfull's low-key performance, turning her rasp from jaded to shy."
0," Zoolander 2 sweats its silly ass off to please. The results are scattershot. But when it works - oh, baby."
1," In a Valley of Violence does not take itself too seriously (a great asset), but it also takes itself just seriously enough that it's not empty snarky parody."
1, ...there's a lot worth recommending about the film.
0," Unfortunately, pasted around that stunning [action] sequence is a story so clogged with cliches of every description, so overblown, bombastic and agonizingly sentimental that it's hard to watch it with a straight face."
1, Undeniably fast and wickedly witty.
0," This is a film that appeals to the head far more than to the heart, making for a portrait that seems somewhat less than complete."
1," ...a swashbuckling, exciting tale. "
1, Blockers is the sex comedy that was promised.
1," This movie is by turns brilliant and dumb, naive and wise, nowhere near good enough and something close to great. "
0," No, really, that's [it] now: 'What if instead of an absurdly short-tempered psychotic hermit who snaps, the Grinch is a mildly depressed neurotic who doesn't manage seasonal affective disorder very well and eventually escalates for no good reason?'"
0," Despite a great storyline (being based on the novel of the same name by Erika Holzer), this contemporary suspense/ drama about a mother-turned-vigilante is just too predictable."
1, Don't be put off by the ridiculous R rating. This is definitely a film to be shared with your teens and preteens. Think of it as a warm up to the next installment of 'The Hunger Games.'
1," ""The Details"" is not just entertaining, but potentially useful."
1, Extremely amusing if admittedly slight entertainment.
0," I was poised to reclaim Franco as an earthy humanist, peering into the grimmer nooks and crannies of our existence. Then, alas, came Chronic's disastrous punchline."
0," O filme conta com sua parcela de momentos inspirados, mas Mamet aposta demais em suas reviravoltas habituais sem se preocupar com a lï¿½ï¿½gica da trama ou com os personagens, investindo ainda num final terrivelmente maniqueï¿½ï¿½sta e art"
0," The intensity of the subjects they address offsets the histrionic tendencies in the film's execution. There's no such defence, though, for the soapy subplots."
0," A mealy conglomeration of high-school-sports movies, teacher-who-motivates-students movies, and inner-city-kids-have-a-tough-life movies."
1," Collet-Serra manages to sustain tension throughout, prudently deploying his jumps and jolts and pumping up the grue factor. So while it often prompts hoots of derision, they're often choked off with a vice-tight wince."
1," A witty, winning new comedy of relationships and culture-clash that eschews complicated plotting to instead luxuriate in a 1, fun, wound-up energy all its own."
1," I felt myself deteriorating at much the same rate Ralston was, making his ability to overcome his travails all the more exhilarating."
0," Jessica Chastain is a fine actress. Idris Elba is a fine actor. Aaron Sorkin is one of the greatest screenwriters to ever live. Unfortunately, the three of them flounder here in this."
0," Unfortunately, The Roommate is too timid to make an impression of any kind."
0, Moving but at times overearnest.
0," Practically a talk where Derbez, playing the poor man's Patch Adams, tries to convince you to be a Christian. [Full review in Spanish]"
0," The songs in ""Rock of Ages"" are by bands like Twisted Sister, Starship, Styx, Foreigner, Poison and Journey, but are sung by the actors. They are as familiar as they are forgettable, like the film itself."
1," As Balor, [Damian Lewis'] sour, guilt-ridden Protestant work ethic clashes increasingly with that of his wife Aislin, an ethereal Celtic creature seemingly washed in from the sea, played by Andrea Riseborough."
1," Despite the clunkiness, Estevez's commitment to his father's generation's idealism (and its murder) commands respect."
1," Zombieland is nowhere near the classic it has been labelled, and is more a film that will be encrusted in this time and place. Give it a few years, and it will seem as relevant as the latest game console. "
0, The movie spends all its 137 minutes convincing us how dazzlingly intellectual it is.
0," As filtered through screenwriter Philip Railsback's pen, Kearns' extraordinary life is rendered...well, ordinary."
1," [L]ike its '70s/'80s forebears, it combines outrageous quantities of fake blood and viscera with an antihero on a righteous mission."
1," Klapisch has made something deliciously close to a nature documentary about the young, the foolish, and the alive."
1," You wouldn't guess a radio-address could be as rousing and nail-biting as a climactic boxing match or a karate competition, but beneath all the manners and monarchs, Speech is a classic -- and expertly crafted -- underdog."
0," This soggy, uninspired entertainment seems to demonstrate that director Ben Younger, who did such a terrific job with the stock-swindle movie Boiler Room, doesn't have the chops for a comedy that's trying to be funny and perceptive."
0," All the inter-cutting between the barren stage and the barren desert ultimately has a distancing, artificial effect that waters down much of the dramatic potency generated by the shared experience of a live performance."
1," If you really hate sex, fast driving, drinking and Norse gods smoothing chassis than you will absolutely despise Rush. "
1, Menacingly brilliant.
1," For a movie musical fan like me, 'Hairspray' has it all --rousing song-and-dance routines, talented performers, a feel-good story, and timeless appeal."
1," The film eschews a chronological narrative and biopic tropes, resulting in poetic and serene observations, rather than glib fact checking."
1," Gently paced and exquisitely shot, this story - tinged with magical realism - tells of an anxious young woman finding her way in the world after the death of her mother."
1," Chronicle such a dynamic and genuinely exciting piece of first-time feature film-making, giving birth to an equally exciting rising star in DeHaan."
1," Average family comedy that's saved by likeable performances from Vaughn and Witherspoon, though it bungles its emotional finale and feels a little flat as a result."
0," Even those sympathetic to the picture's cause will recognize it as a case of shoddy journalism, not so much due to its partisan mind-set but because it lacks clarity and revelation."
0," While the whole film is professionally executed and goes down smoothly enough, the underlying stupidity of its subject matter can't help but show through in the end."
0, Too much suffering with too little change for 131 minutes makes for a sleepy film viewer even considering the loving care of the direction and acting
1, It would be overstating it to suggest that Besson is enjoying a major creative renaissance but Lucy is the best film he has made in a very long time.
1," ... light entertainment that wants to share a moment in the lives of the characters who, like us, are no longer young. [Full review in Spanish]"
0," Moore's partisan and simplistic approach feels more like a big, fat insult to audience intelligence rather than an effective call to arms."
0," ""Passengers"" is beautiful to look at, a pretty story about pretty people in a pretty (outer space) setting, but it cannot overcome the ick factor of its premise."
0," An inspirational drama that, unlike most faith-based endeavors, at least looks like a real movie rather than something even Ed Wood would have rejected."
1," They've tapped into the inherent psychedelia of Revelation and enhanced it with absurdity, scatology, Ecstasy, weed and a contemporary secular ignorance informed by Terminator movies."
1," This animated fairytale is visually dazzling, fun and weaves an atmosphere somewhere between magical and creepy."
0, Mike Myers channels his inner Benny Hill for the endlessly juvenile comedy The Love Guru
0," Disappointment comes in all weights and flavors, but the brand that's generated by Hal Ashby's Shampoo is a bit harder to swallow than some."
0, Middlebrow mediocrity served up by the Weinsteins on a silver platter for awards season. 
1," When Elinor is gesturing the great story of her daughter's history and legacy and wonderfulness, literally over the heads of men, Brave represents an experience that so many mothers and daughters have shared, but rarely see in a movie."
0," If you enjoyed Jumanji, the Robin Williams film about the board game with the wild animals that come to life, then ... the rest of this sentence should read: ""...you are a dullard who should be slapped repeatedly."""
0, Even Redford bailing water for 106 minutes can be a bit much.

1," ...the return of the artist who gave us School Daze, She's Gotta Have It, Bamboozled and Do the Right Thing."
1," [An] ambitious multi-generational epic that, even at three hours, feels too brisk. We actually want more time with these fascinating people."
1, What's great about this alternately cozy and depressing domestic drama from Mike Leigh is how matter-of-fact it is.
1, A welcome addition to films exploring complex teen girl protagonists.
0, It's fast and flashy but it wants a bit of heart. 
1," This is a genuine romantic comedy. It's funny, honest, and%u2026romantic. Who'da thunk?"
0, Cody's search for his inner dude has produced a dud
0," McKinnon sports the worst Australian accent in the history of the acting profession, but it's still one of the best things about this no-class female version of Weekend at Bernie's Meets The Hangover. "
0, The most inspiring element of the film is the genuine fortitude and loyalty that Maines and her bandmates Emily Robinson and Martie Maguire exhibit outwardly and to one another.
0," Once you dig beneath the slick surface, it's all quite formulaic and predictable, hardly bothering to explain the logic."
0," In Robin Hood, you can't see the forest for the cheese."
1," Triste como A Espinha do Diabo, esta ï¿½ï¿½ uma obra de forï¿½ï¿½a inegï¿½ï¿½vel e de poï¿½ï¿½tica melancolia, encerrando-se com uma nota ambï¿½ï¿½gua que levarï¿½ï¿½ o espectador a refletir profundamente sobre o qu"
1," Sony's animated adventure brings together several well-known iterations of Spider-Man for plenty of clever, self-referential riffs and dynamic action sequences. "
0," The Water Diviner almost succeeds by way of its unfaltering sincerity, but the movie is too unfocused ... for it to have much of an effect."
1," As the movie is about a character's growing into his own truth rather than discovering some preordained truth, Definitely, Maybe is hard to outguess. For once in a romantic comedy you won't be able to tell after 5 minutes who will end up together."
1," As a piece of visual ephemera, it's a stunning achievement, as an in-depth look at the depravity of the human soul, it's truly only skin deep."
1, Kosinki's tonal balance is commendable between the forced spectacularity of much of the footage and the more emotional [moments]. [Full Review in Spanish] 
1," Warm and wry, funny and sad, cute and complicated."
1, The extraordinary success of Arrival is that it combines its bravura style and grand sci-fi questions with tremendous emotional intelligence and a heart so full it's ready to burst.
1," Bright Star isn't in the same ballpark as The Piano - heck, it's not even in the same time zone - but it's the first Campion movie since then to warrant 10 Best consideration."
1, Nichols weaves it all together with consummate skill and a little black pepper.
1," Sometimes too overblown, surreal and obtuse for its own good, director Paolo Sorrentino's film is nonetheless an exquisitely composed portrait of vapidity and decline."
0, THE MULE is one of the worst films of the year. It's nothing more than a vehicle for Eastwood to have a good time singing and cavorting with much younger women. 
0," Everyone in the cast works, especially the always-charming Monroe, but they're working in something that keeps missing the few punches it tries to throw."
1," A pretty sensational and tough British crime drama. A real gem, and visually stunning to boot. "
0, Robert De Niro is having sex with Carla Gugino. I know. It's like witnessing a traffic accident where an Edsel keeps slamming into a shiny red Corvette.
0," It is not hard to wonder if ""Truth"" the screenplay might have rang its bell a bit more clearly in the hands of another director, another set of eyes and hands to distill the material."
0," Malcolm loyalists are too sophisticated for this simple script, and fans of the spy genre have so many better options."
0, It seems this half-baked film only uses explosions to use shield us from the plot holes.

1," It's simple, but effective."
0," It's sad to say this after such a fun, adventurous return to the franchise in Jurassic World, but Fallen Kingdom is not the sequel we were hoping for."
1," The movie does at least broaden the canvas the story is played out on, but fans expecting to see many of the series' usual haunts -- school, Moe's Tavern, the nuclear plant -- will be disappointed to find that they are merely glimpsed here. For all its sh"
0," Director Jose Padilha seems to be conflicted about the story he is trying to tell. He must know that people who point guns at children's heads, no matter how noble their long-term goals may be, are inherently unsympathetic."
1," Montage of Heck is about the representation and self-representation of Kurt Cobain, a fascinating process for any figure whose entire fame was based on modes of self-representation."
1," This epic, tragically devastating documentary not only puts human faces on Congo's seemingly endless cycle of corruption and violence but investigates what lies behind it."
1," A cautionary tale about scientists and schemers messing with Mother Nature, the film makes its point. But it takes at least 30 minutes to get going."
0," In her own film, Nanny McPhee holds the impact of a day player."
1," The wildlife is beautifully photographed, and the film is stentorianally narrated by Sir Patrick Stewart."
0, Wedding Crashers meets The Hangover. But in a bad way.
1, A coming of age tale that delivers a strong message about sexual identity for both the young and those who remember being young.
1," Dull jokes, a bloated running time and a lack of proper pacing is somewhat remedied by a charmingly honest representation of a dysfunctional family."
1, There are interesting questions about what constitutes true heroism in the aptly named Hero but it's the aesthetic splendor and weird kineticism that you remember.
0," There is more to like in Sing Street than there is to hate, but it is the missteps that truly stay with you."
0," Very cold, analytical, and sort of pretentious. Its no Piranha 3D!"
0, Not since Valmont followed on the heels of Dangerous Liaisons has there been such a fascinating compare/contrast double feature.
1," An unforgettable coming-of-age comedy that's sweet, witty, and brings back the joys of being young and full of life. "
1, So much better than its predecessor that I've gone from being merely disappointed with the 2012 reboot to being downright angry about it.
0, ... stretches credibility before completely flying off the rails in the third act.
0," Next time out, Southcombe should get someone else to write the screenplay ..."
1," It succeeds as a moving story of a boy, expressively played by Aaron Johnson, whose life would have been interesting enough to justify a movie about it even if he'd never gone on to be one of The Beatles."
1," Delpy... skillfully deploys her decidedly nonprecious quirk in order to slide some sly, wise observations about the compromises of all sorts of love and relationships into her funny slice of New York life."
0, A bleak and morally meaningless cop flick.
1," It's pitch perfect in writing, mood, and scares, and still holds up to scrutiny, no matter how harsh."
0," Reiner's film is slick and glib when it means to be profound yet ruefully witty; its rhythms are pure sitcom, complete with emotional rimshots."
1," While the film's needlessly abrupt ending prevents it from working on its own terms, ""The Desolation of Smaug"" is quite nearly a great Hobbit film, filled with wondrous invention, genuine pathos, and many great performances."
1, Cowboys & Aliens is so preposterous that it could collapse into a steaming pile of Wild Wild West at any moment. Yet the actors are so good at appearing convinced that this malarkey is really happening.
1, Mizrahi's circumscribed scope gives the film focus and density.
1," How to care and feed your very own vampire, or how to ensnare and manipulate your very own human?"
1, Classic '80s send-up of Canada; lots of beer drinking. 
1," Tackling dark topics like abuse, poverty and dysfunctional love, the drama film is unapologetically blunt and does little to cover up the harsh reality of living in one of Romania's most gruesome suburbs."
0," If you're looking for a good cry, Megan Leavey gets the job done, I suppose. But it's a bit like a wet kiss from a puppy."
1," Sanders does not (yet) share Guillermo del Toro's gifts, but he, too, has an eye for the beautiful and the grotesque, and for that entrancing borderline where the two meet."
1, Starts out as a vivid portrait of the Civil Rights era and ends up a cop drama in which vengeful anger is used against racist killers.
1, A re1ingly uncynical and surprisingly practical portrait of two people learning how to take life at face value and embrace the joy which is made available to them.
0," The life-or-death urgency is underpowered, when a few jolts are needed."
0, White Boy Rick suffers from the disease of a movie that lacks charisma.
0, This movie would a helluva lot better with paper mache sets.
0, I can honestly and accurately state that a dental cleaning is more enjoyable than watching this inaugural release from the Weinstein Company
1," More B-movies could stand to be like ""The Shelter,"" which at least tries to tie its darkness to something real."
1," A good story well told: solid, meticulously crafted, with that similar, slightly old-fashioned feeling you got from watching a film like Salt."
0," ...as Natalie Portman Talks Dirty movies go, the winner and still champion is 2004's Closer."
1," Without Rivette's usual daring or playfulness, but still a highly accomplished entry in the lazy, stagnant ""costume movie"" genre."
1, I smiled for the first half of the movie and started laughing hysterically when a supporting character hijacked it from its stars.
1, It takes a long time getting to the final shootout.
0," As talking-dog movies go, Marmaduke makes Beverly Hills Chihuahua look like Up."
0, You could put Will Smith in this and call it Wild Wild West Europe or Nicolas Cage and call it International Treasure.
0," This sequel wants to be ""Back to the Future"" - but is more ""The Big Bang Theory"". Combined with a lack of real scares, it's simply not worth seeing on the big screen."
0," Better than the last film, but the latest in this disappointing franchise is ""Shrek"" out of luck."
1," Escapist films about, well, escaping, don't come any better than this."
1," In Bruges, with its blunt, black wit running up against its moral fiber, manages to have its violent-crime-comedy cake and transcend it too."
0," A vaudeville of entertainment, of which revenge and swordsmanship are only two of the acts"
0," This ludicrous actioner strives to be as loud, violent, and patriotic as possible."
1, This is a heavy documentary where the director and his team became actual war correspondants... you can't miss it. [Full review in Spanish]
0," With sky-blue tools, gloves and mask, the killer looks so much like a member of the Blue Man Group that you expect him to spit marshmallows at his victims."
1," ... Bateman proves his direction as remarkable at the very least, giving the drama and comedy film a suspenseful and skeptically ominous feeling ... "
1, A witty and provocative exploration of the craft that goes into our favorite medium.
0," Its tonal schizophrenia gets the best of it -- the material careens wildly between sly comedy and creeping suspense, with some ill-advised detours into Borscht-belt humor."
0, London Has Fallen occupies that uncomfortable territory between being out-and-out awful and so bad it's very nearly worth a look.
1," ... it's interesting to see the story from the viewpoint of a female journalist--one whose capabilities as a mother, a wife and a law-abiding citizen are constantly questioned... "
0," Crude, knockabout stuff."
0, Evening is not without interest. The problem is that most of the interest stems from the inevitable fascination generated by watching a slow-motion train wreck.
0," The relatively tense final half-hour is clearly the reason that very smart producer Jason Blum thought this would be a solid follow-up to ""Paranormal Activity."" It's that first hour that is the reason it took six years to (barely) get released."
0," Can we knock it off already with the mandatory mommy movies? Plus, you know a film's in trouble when there's a whole lot more chemistry and emotional depth between the girlfriends, than with Graham and any or all of those potential male suitor studs."
0, Why is it so hard to make a true story feel real?
0," Johnson and Wayans have a potential buddy future, but ""Let's Be Cops"" is not the strongest vehicle to get them there."
0," The movie is never quite bold enough to point out the contradiction of Muslims and Christians hating one another, even though they both in theory worship the same god."
0, Thoroughly pedestrian in both conception and execution when it's not downright offensive.
0," Worse, there's no psychological meat here, no unearthed motivation behind why Carlos has chosen a life of increasingly serious crime."
0," Suffused with an overwhelming, choking feeling of pure boredom, shading into self-loathing."
1," A playful and frantic science-fiction twister which mimics the best (Aliens, The Matrix, Groundhog Day) while offering something 1 and - most importantly - thrilling."
1, The picture's only weakness is that the pair's antics pale in comparison to those exhibited by the low-class trash you can find making fools of themselves any day of the week on the average episode of the Jerry Springer Show.
1," The writing/directing team of Joel and Ethan Coen create a laugh-a-minute black comedy that pokes fun at America's surveillance-dominated existence, plastic surgery desires, and all out greed."
0," This dystopia flick offers a pseudo-allegory for teenagehood along with a predictable plot, bland setting, and pat romance. So it conforms to today's alt-world teen-film formula."
0, An orgy of CGI bat and battle stuff -- all of which is remarkably bloodless to hold tight to that PG-13 rating. It's all pretty tepid and mostly cartoonish. 
0," Is this really an honest portrait of a beautiful and intense friendship between women? What's intense about it, or beautiful, or honest?"
1," Taken as a whole, this eighth episode of the franchise will be porgnip for the faithful, though the answer to one of its Big Questions seems disappointing, and generously entertaining for the rest of us."
1," Though the film isn't exactly deep, Steinfeld makes it watchable and there's amusing support from Woody Harrelson as her wry teacher."
1," Get ready for a movie about the magic, heartbreak and frustration of making a movie, along with some of the best acting performances of the year. "
1," The mood isn't particularly new, and Malick's deliberately elliptical style doesn't feel quite as 1 as it did a few years ago, before younger, less talented filmmakers began imitating him. Yet there's still something hypnotic here ..."
0, The narrative flails its way through a series of contrivances and feeble attempts at humour.
1," More than a pure actors' director, Finley shows himself to be a theater product with a strikingly clear cinematic vision."
1," Under a less masterful hand, you'd be dying for a fistfight, a sex scene or a gunshot to shatter the calm. But Koreeda makes thrilling the rich inner lives of four young women trying to navigate rocky emotional terrain in the wake of their father's death."
1," Bruce Wayne's invention of Batman is the story of Batman Begins, and it's an epic one, with a suitably epic cast of A-list actors."
1," Director Alexei Fedorchenko doesn't use sheer duration to immerse viewers in the spiritual journey. Not counting the credits, this beautifully photographed and quietly evocative movie is barely 70 minutes long."
1," Be assured that The Witness for the Prosecution is fascinating, maddening and ultimately heartbreaking."
0, A miserable piece of crap from Hollywood ... scatotogical and obscene.
1," The Seventies are scarily well recreated, Powley is both fearless and excellent, and Skarsgï¿½ï¿½rd does a fine job of capturing the ambiguities of a character who must attract as much as he rep"
1," Some works of art are inexhaustible, and this is proving one of them."
1," Despite Tony Scott managing to maintain his high-octane style, the relative simplicity of the plot gives Unstoppable a more intimate feel than his usual bombastic actioner"
0," If you get people to pay for tickets to a show where the big selling point is they'll hear songs they already know and love, why bother creating an actual story or compelling characters?"
1," A worthy tribute documentary that digs up recognition for the musicians who backed up Marvin Gaye, the Temptations and other Motown legends."
1, Finding Neverland is as relentlessly fanciful as Peter Pan itself.
0, Handsome but coldly uninvolving and pretentious.
0," It may be non-stop action, but it's boring action - where was the ""Left Hand of God"" when they really needed evil to be wiped out (obviously not in the editing room)."
1, Parental Content Review
0," A textbook example of the kind of nonsense that typically opens in January, Replicas begins as so-bad-it's-good, then quickly morphs into merely it's-so-bad. A must-miss."
1," A gentle, fan-friendly Iggy Pop doc."
0," For a movie about a guy jumping around a lot, this one is pretty flat."
1," The film is a reminder that the Internet has a good side, a connective power above and beyond the haze of ignorance and hate that seems to permeate it these days. We could probably use a little more of that reminding."
0, This isn't so much a film made for the digital millenials but the Trump era.
1," A compact, punchy film without an ounce of flab on it ... It's just a short, sharp, bullet-driven bulldozer of a movie that snaps necks and blows out brains."
1," Conjecture, rumor, theory...that is no surprise. What will have your jaw dropping is [Oliver]Stone's even-handed, straight-ahead, almost nice treatment of [George W.]Bush."
1," It's both 1 and familiar, comedy and tragedy, straightforward narrative and think-piece parable. It's also one of the best films of the year."
0," There are a few droll moments sprinkled throughout ""Birthmarked,"" which merely highlight the dreariness of the many, many others that are not."
0," Spike Lee's state-of-the-union address has ambition to burn, and it burns it to the ground. "
1," It's baaad, and great."
0," Once shots are fired, the film descends into a repetitive orgy of bullets and bad jokes."
0," if Kasdan's point was to use the film as metaphor, its attitude towards the audience is spiteful at best"
1," It boasts competence all around, two boffo performances by DiCaprio and Blanchett (whose Hepburn is near-perfect), terrific directing (maybe this is finally Scorsese's year), great cinematography by Robert Richardson, and a fascinating subject."
1, A love letter to innocence and euphoria and the sheer lifting joy of great pop music.
0, Captivity the movie has been thoroughly eclipsed by Captivity the marketing.
1," A dark, often funny Oedipal and erotic tale from Young Adam director David Mackenzie, Mister Foe benefits from the emotionally and physically agile performance of Bell."
1," If you never saw the TV show, you'll still laugh."
1, A deconstruction and reconstruction of the Sherlock Holmes character before the last chapter of his live ends. [Full review in Spanish]
1," in a curious inversion of romantic norms, there will be obstacles aplenty in the way of this couple's blissful split"
0, It's not real. It's not honest. It lacks the magic to live forever. 
0," There's no story here. The film is all about the grisly, electric mayhem that ensues when these two guys hit the streets."
1, A largely inspiring and transporting portrait.
1," Twee, yes, but Forever My Girl has plenty of heart and some solid performances. A journey not entirely without pleasure..."
1," Berlinger and Sinofsky, with their knack for penetrating the diabolical pretensions of weak and disaffected human beings, have brought Metallica to its knees."
0," As any film aimed at children but potentially traumatizing for them might be, ""A Dog's Purpose"" is at odds with itself, straining to balance the levity of poop jokes with the tragedy of loss."
0," The movie's trademark mix of live action and drawing techniques (white silhouettes, reddened lips, an abundance of venetian blinds) looks fantastic. If it's depth you want, you've knocked on the wrong door."
1," While the superficial interest of Mendoï¿½ï¿½a seems to be in a necessary and tragic story as any one in which gentrification is within reach, beneath it, Aquarius tends a very pleasant carpet, made of memories. [Full review in Span"
0, I think if I were not diligently taking notes for this very review I might have folded laundry or something to pass the time... It's a beautiful movie to look at and a clumsy story with a weird ending.
1, There are some laughs - but the jokes don't come thick and fast. The film's portrayal of friendship is always warm and sensitive.
0," There are some good monster moments that, with more build up, would have been startling. We want to see more action, we don't want to read about it or hear people talk about it."
0," Sommers showers us with noise and color, but the film rarely generates much in the way of real excitement. There's a freeze-dried feel to much of the movie..."
0," The only thing of note is that its star, Matthew McConaughey, doesn't remove his shirt"
1," The story is more convoluted than the previous installments and it runs a bit slow in the middle, but it remains entertaining."
0," All of this is a fine bromance of little substance or depth-there's something to be explored about choosing your own family, but having one character list the rest of the characters' problems is not the same anyone having nuance."
1, The only Stephen Daldry film I've seen that I don't expect to feel the need to revisit.
0," It pains me to say it, but as far as I can see it's an extended and slightly better crafted example of those fake 'reality TV' shows."
1," Rich in texture and colour, music and aura."
1," Satisfying, action-packed prequel explores Han's roots. "
0," Missing that childlike love for nature and animals that Beatrix must have had, and in turn, forgets what it's like to have an imagination."
1," The director-star dynamic made a hit of their first movie together (Edge of Tomorrow), and it's what makes American Made work, too."
0," The camera-eye view is treated more as an obstacle to be overcome than a tool for storytelling, raising the question of why not just scrap it altogether."
0," ""The Beaver"" is almost successful, despite the premise of its screenplay, which I was simply unable to accept."
1," From the opening moments of the film, ""The Predator"" maintains an engaging swashbuckling sci-fi energy and strikes a strong balance of humor and action that evokes the best of its genre"
0," ""The death of one man is a tragedy, the death of millions is a statistic,"" Joseph Stalin is alleged to have said. That philosophy applies very nicely to the modern disaster movie"
1," Don't Say a Word may not be entirely logical, but it is shamelessly entertaining."
1," It often feels like there is a great film within Jeune Femme, but it just got lost in the editing suite; the emotional essence of Paula's struggle remains, but it just doesn't hit as hard as it should do."
0," Beckinsale is laughable as the kick ass vengeful wife with clipped Brit accent, high-heeled boots and flouncy hair. Not since War Horse has a mane of hair swished as much on screen."
0," After the intensity of ""Black Swan,"" it's sort of jarring to see Portman in something as vapid and and inconsequential as this. Kutcher? It's not quite so jarring."
0," Michael Roberts's documentary is an unabashed exercise in deifying its subject matter with superlatives and hyperbole from the mouths of talking heads, which ultimately results in the cheapening of the artist. "
0," God, The Sound of Music is so freakin' nice."
1," If you're not discussing this marvelous film on the ride home, you didn't pay close enough attention."
1," The audience for ""Knife + Heart"" is narrow, but I suspect it'll be deep."
1, An unusual and uneven mix of genres that is both intriguing and rewarding.
0," Blended throws a lot of things on the screen, but in the end, it has to confront its awkward and artificial ""romance."" And that's just ugly."
0," For all its teary, heartfelt melodrama and bloodily chaotic machine gun fury there is very little here to hold on to, and while sitting through all 137-minutes is hardly a chore it's not like doing so has done me any favors."
0," I would recommend The Spirit to a cinematography buff, but I can't think of anyone else who would go for it."
1," Gloriously bonkers. Like, Looney Tunes levels of cartoon madness. You will laugh your homo sapien head off."
1," It's a tremendously effective, forthright entertainment, and Frears and Buffini make their craftsmanship look easy, creating a soap-farce pastoral of Brit bourgeois out-of-towners."
1," I'm not making this up: I had a coughing fit during 'Contagion.'Luckily, I was sitting at the very back of the theater, so I was less likely (I hope) to add to the tension unfolding on the screen. "
0, Kieran Turner's Jobriath A.D. is an admirable attempt to rescue the singer from the junk heap of failed pop culture & it was obviously made with a lot of love & care. However...only a sketchy impression of the artist's real personality comes through
0," This ""sequel"" has no lyrical or dramatic force to speak of. [Full review in Spanish]"
0," Punchy, cleverly stylized, but utterly empty."
1, Silent Hill renders the look and feel of the game with perfect clarity... But it's this unwavering fidelity to the source material that is also the film's biggest problem.
1," A modest film that approaches subjects like courage, sacrifice and commitment to our ideals. [Full review in Spanish]"
1," Working with extremely limited lighting, Herzog not only gives a sense of the caves as a sinuous, tactile environment, but focuses on the movement suggested by the paintings."
1," Some sequels have such a complicated back story they should come with printed footnotes. The latest sequel in the ""X-Men"" series requires an encyclopedia that can be read in a fun-house mirror."
0, It does seem strange that a franchise whose original appeal was futuristic should now be treasured entirely as faithfully retrospective. But there it is.
0, First Reformed ends up feeling like a film that needed another draft or two to help iron out the wrinkles in its main character's arc.
1," What makes it a better-than-average satire on the unthinking hostilities that human beings are prone to is its steady intelligence, combined with a humor sometimes so dry as to be undetectable."
0," So excruciatingly awful, the word 'dumb' could sue for slander."
1," Thoroughbreds often feels like a very, very expensive B-movie, but it's all reasonably watchable, thanks to the elegant cinematography and Cooke's amusing way of playing teenage amorality. "
1," The drama is cliched, if competently effective, but Cameron's dissolves from the Titanic's rusted hulk to her brand spanking new decks are breathtaking, even poetic."
1," There are plenty of high-tech gunbattles in this ""Robo,"" which make it a real pulse-pounder. But it's the intelligence behind the gunplay that makes it distinctive."
1," A Simple Favor isn't very memorable, but at least you won't be annoyed by stereotypes or misogyny while watching it."
0, Most of the humor is about as 1 as the air left behind whenever Witherspoon uses a toilet.
1," It will especially ring bells for addicts and their families, but it is an all-round enjoyable watch."
1," 'This is stupendous,' participant Welch says of the concert. Spectators will feel the same way."
1," If this movie doesn't put you in the Christmas spirit, you're either dead...or Jewish."
0," Aiming for mass appeal, 'Risen' falls short of its target. "
0," It is, quite simply, a poorly conceived and constructed film."
0," The narrative has the choppy quality of a badly bowdlerised book, and the result is not bad so much as boring - and best thought of as a tree, fallen in the forest, that nobody heard."
1," Pride and Prejudice and Zombies is not a perfect movie, but it works very well as a vehicle of entertainment. [Full Review in Spanish]"
1," It's all a bit much, yes, a bit exhausting, that's true, but then why on Earth would anyone expect otherwise?"
0, The lesson offered here seems geared toward those viewers who were surprised by the Rodney King video.
1, This is a documentary that has found a way of bringing the past alive without pretending too much that it is other than past. 
0," Is That a Gun in Your Pocket? gets all its tropes, beats, and characters from ghastly sitcoms of the 1990s - long-running trash like Full House, Home Improvement, Family Matters, and The Nanny."
0," A few perceptive moments from the film will remain with me, but I suspect it'll be more in the language of unrelated memories; I wouldn't know where to place them, or why they appeal to me in a particular context. "
1," The film is so restrained you may wonder whether it's a horror movie at all, and not a kitchen-table drama about an imploding family."
1," A dreamlike and poetically opaque mosaic that, in the end, is a lot like Dylan's music itself, in that it invites analysis but stubbornly defies interpretation."
0," While this documentary features rare performance footage of hard-core punk-rock bands Black Flag and Bad Brains, it's not exactly the best-assembled or deepest cinematic exploration of the subject."
0," All ""Skyscraper"" has going for it is a tall building."
0, [Screenwriter Jon] Spaihts and director Morten Tyldum turn Jim's essentially murderous act ... into fodder for a discomforting romance.
0, Fifty Years is guilty of being gratingly generic and of accepting too tough a challenge: to properly explore a hugely significant collection of songs without featuring any of them.
0, There's only one answer to this epistolary screen romance: Return to Sender.
1," There is great pleasure in the matter-of-fact way Jenkins and Heinberg make points about chauvinism, sexism, and equality through pointed humor and practical examples, and how deftly Diana sweeps aside all attempts by men to dismiss her. "
0," Peter Webber's historical drama is blunt about its stylistic ambitions while at the same time failing to meet them, and the effect is one of sad ineffectuality. "
0," Like most of Neil LaBute's work in the field of ""emotional terrorism,"" the film protests that bad behavior isn't only good, but also essential to art."
1," It was inevitable that one of Hollywood's many recent reboots would eventually attain sentience. Hence the arrival of 21 Jump Street, a film that not only knows it's a remake, but knows how absurd it has to be to succeed as a remake."
1," It's the epitome of a summer blockbuster. The explosive action is practically nonstop, breaking only occasionally for jokes and a touch of romance - though without ever breaking its grim, apocalyptic tone."
1, 'Enough Said' says plenty...beautifully and effortlessly.
1, You feel the movie closing in on you the same way that life is closing in on the characters.
1," It's a studied movie that gives itself over to bursts of intensity, and between them sometimes threatens to become as spellbound by its subjects as they become with each other."
0, Deliver Us from Evil is basically a dull police procedural with just enough supernatural to separate it from an episode of Criminal Minds.
0, All Die Hard movies lack sense -- that's a given. This one lacks personality. And that's unforgivable.
0," Despite some decent laughs scattered here and there, the film begins to drag and feels long. (Full Content Review for Parents also available)"
1, There are all sorts of pleasures still to be had.
0," ""Runner Runner"" comes up short of being a full house at the movies."
0, Director David Gordon Green and writers Danny McBride and Ben Best have put together a completely unfunny film filled to the brim with non-stop sexual references and other bits of lowbrow humor.
0, A sad illustration of the decline in Hollywood screenwriting.
1, You can expect to see this heartwarming documentary debut on the [Netflix] later this year.
0, Jerry Lewis deserves a better homage than this.
1, The great insight in director Roger Michell's fourth collaboration with writer Hanif Kureishi is its vision of Paris as an arena equally amenable to romantic comedy and sulking tragedy.
1," Chen winds up with little more than an elaborate shaggy cat story, although one that is not without its fair share of incidental pleasures."
1," There are some movies that have little or nothing to recommend them, except as a frame for a performance. My Week with Marilyn is that kind of movie."
1," Three Monkeys is not without certain melodramatic flaws, but they are absorbed by the film's stylistic plausibility, by the way the framing and the stunning use of digital photography creates its own sort of psychological reality."
0, So-so surf docu sequel has more sexual content than original 
0," A few big stars working in a minor key, a bit of macabre indie-film quirk, and presto! Instant junk."
1," Spring is an ambitious work and really sticks the landing, with a phenomenal final scene. It also features great work from its two leads, and some really remarkable creature feature dynamics without overplaying those elements."
0, Amy Schumer is always fun company. But who the hell thought that making plus-size jokes then simply tacking on a moralizing ending was hilarious? Or acceptable?
0, This sentimental father and son tale adapted from an Oliver Sacks essay by Gwyn Lurie and Gary Marks plays it altogether too genteelly for the turbulent times it depicts.
1," It is stylish, lacerating as a social insight and extremely well-acted by the entire no-superstar ensemble led by Frances McDormand."
0," A mirthful, edgeless dramedy."
1," Gyllenhaal may be convincing, even sympathetic, as a man in the manic throes of guilt, regret and emotional isolation he can barely register, let alone articulate. But the story ultimately strands his character in another limbo state."
1, The brilliant cast Clooney has assembled are delivering some of their finest work in telling this story.
0," Writer Charlie Kaufman is the pseudo-intellectuals' ""intellectual."" He's pompous, self-flagellating and pretentious. So they love him. Kaufman makes Sarah Palin seem humble."
0," Through it all, Rami Malek turns in a fine performance, full of nuance and subtlety. But even that's not enough to fix a movie that doesn't have a clear point."
1, A thoroughly delightful bauble about female friendship and the double-edged sword of getting to know someone who seems far cooler than you.
0," Witless, technically slipshod, and neither remotely scary nor titillating, it pretty much fails on all levels."
0," Not just a dull but an oppressive experience, being force-fed a corporate product: a film that never comes alive, with none of the characters properly developed, none of the relationships gelling, the very adventure formulaic."
1, Peppered with the best fairytale spoofs since Jay Ward's Fractured Fairy Tales.
1," It serves up its cautionary tale with a schlocky blend of dark humor, breakneck action, and unsettling body horror."
1," McQueen shows Sand's skin and bones then his blurred view of the ceiling, always striking a balance between static, distant observation and the taste of abraded knuckles."
0," The flick is a very plain Jane version of a disaster film with mediocre special effects, no character depth whatsoever and is just a complete waste of money."
1, The audience will feel like a fly on the wall in a no-holds-barred approach in which no topic is off limits. The filmmakers condensed more than a year of footage into 84 fascinating minutes...
0," The best thing you can say about it is that the acting is alright, there are a few decently executed moments of nastiness, the whole thing is in focus and you can understand what's being said."
0," Thoroughly predictable, no more than mildly amusing, and utterly maudlin when it veers into sentimental mode."
0," Haunting of Connecticut doesn't have to worry about line-straddling, its crummy scares and laughable stabs at a faith-restored narrative granting it permanent residence in the realm of C-grade cheese."
1," This is a visually striking, technologically impressive picture."
1, A unique and unpredictably screwy ride.
0," Great publicity, dumb move. The title alone is a spoiler. "
1," Beloved Sisters moves at an almost breathless clip, without ever violating its characters' slow sense of time, which is defined by horse-drawn coaches and posted letters."
0, There's no such thing as narrative coherence in this movie.
0," This drama styles itself as a cinematic epic, but its substance is as flimsy as a Jack Chick pamphlet."
0," There's a decent joke in For a Good Time, Call... but just one, and it's played over and over again."
1, Hunger is tough going -- and compelling cinema throughout.
1, Its middle section offers one of cinema's most pleasurable offerings: smart people in rooms smartly hashing things out.
1," Like its subject matter, ""Bodied"" is bold storytelling with no punches pulled."
0," Mr. Borden, an acclaimed Canadian stage actor and playwright, turns in a slyly entertaining performance. But the relationship between Lake and Melvyn feels a bit more one-sided than perhaps was intended."
0," Ribisi, such a promising supporting actor in Saving Private Ryan as a medic and Friends as Phoebe's dopey brother, doesn't seem a big enough presence for a starring role yet."
1, There is a certain Gallic pretension here ... but the delicacy and intelligence that the film brings to Nathalie's situation is always admirable.
0, MFKZ is the kind of barely-there fantasy that disappears from your memory even while you're watching it.

0, I can't think of less business-savvy premise for a movie than that of Awake...
1," ""Colossal"" is a challenge, no doubt, but writer-director Nacho Vigalondo pulls it off with a visionary flourish."
1," A taste of what might have been--and even if you doubt that the completed film would have been as remarkable as Jodorowsky and his admirers are inclined to claim, it's a tantalizing taste."
0," Nessie lays an egg literally and figuratively in this inoffensive, visually attractive but highly derivative family movie about a boy and his beastie."
1," I floated in and out of states that included suspense, surprise, delight and shock, all of them adding up to steady-state enjoyment."
0," Waters' ambitions are amusingly perverse, but he hasn't justified why he doesn't portray any truly desirable alternatives for us."
1," Just how much you enjoy Secretariat, Disney's glossy-coated biopic of the celebrated racehorse, depends in large part on how much you know of his career. If you know zilch, you'll be thrilled."
0, Epic is heavy on celebrity voices and light on imagination.
1, An interesting and intense film that lets the viewer make its own conclusions through a very agile ending. [Full review in Spanish]
0," Overstuffed, overlong...and brainless beyond belief...[with a] numbingly convoluted and derivative plot, woodem acting and cheesy effects."
0, A sickly soft-swirl confection of low laughs and smarmy sentiment...
0," While 'Burnt' is totally predictable, and the terms 'slick' and 'feel-good' definitely apply, it'll still hold your attention."
0," An attempt to make a live-action nature film with the same sort of emotional wallop as the legendary 1994 animated smash ""The Lion King,"" ""African Cats"" was doomed to come off as phony."
0," The film does have a modest, commercial watchability, but Steven Knight's screenplay never quite convinces, while Zemeckis seems to believe that with enough camels, vintage Citroï¿½ï¿½n cars and urgent wartime sex, he'll have a big hit on his ha"
1, ...restores your faith in low budgets and dumb ideas. It reminds you both can be fun.
0," For fans of the original TV series, this reboot will feel like a disappointment. For everybody else, a pointless and easily avoidable misfire."
0," Early promise of a poised and substantial piece gets undermined by a final, inexplicable leap into the paranormal -- an odd denouement for a narrative centered on the very real and corporeal issue of gender-based violence."
0," Cue 90 minutes of dutiful twisting and turning, crossing and bloody double-crossing, but not one moment of actual surprise."
0, Eric Bana is absolutely Fabio-lous ... ready to burst from the cover of a romance novel at any moment.
1," Now that the groundwork has been laid, the series is free to really explore some compelling themes."
1, Kahn presents all sides of the subject in such a fascinating and concise manner that his documentary is as educational as it is entertaining.
1," Amy Adams' talent makes us understand Susan's gradual, gut wrenching realization, but in making Wright's themes more obvious, Ford has also given us less reason to care, his approach more satirical."
1, Hoffman hasn't a lot to say in A Most Wanted Man but with his curt asides and air of casual authority he's always a commanding presence.
0," Braff has made a coming of age saga for a grown man. It works in part, his central theme a good one, but his more puerile filmmaking tendencies weaken its impact. Hudson, however, is excellent, the most mature element of a too fanciful film."
0, The Founder is almost satisfying but it seems like it has been under the heat lamps for a little too long and winds up soggy and lacking in flavor.
0," A minor film from director Gus Van Sant, whose crafty humour and existentialism (see the devastating My Own Private Idaho) boils down to what feels like kookiness here."
0," Instead of a cinematic drag queen like the guilty pleasure ""The Fifth Element,"" ""Jupiter Ascending"" is a mutant that's mostly dog."
0," This second live-action film [is] a blend of kinetic violence, bizarre aliens and actors the calibre of Laura Linney wondering what on earth they've got themselves into."
1," It's a film about martyrs, but it's also one that challenges the very notion of martyrdom -- or at least the protagonist's understanding of that concept."
0," While this film is strong in most of the critical areas, its overall vision is so violent, so bloody, and so hopeless, I simply cannot recommend it to anyone, myself included."
0, More like a home movie than a feature length film.
1," Lowery falls back on a number of clichï¿½ï¿½s in his indie romance-cum-Western, drowning the actors in melancholy sunshine and letting them mumble like mad. What he gets right are the charact"
0, [A] painfully dull film ...
1," For an American like Spacey to take on this part at Britain's Old Vic, where he's served as artistic director for a decade, was certainly a risk; to take it on a world tour, from Beijing to Brooklyn, another."
1," While the chef's rock-star persona ... does seem excessive, an excellent script and an immersive performance by Cooper result in an interesting character study."
0," A glossy, good-looking production that never fully delivers on its promise of resurrecting one of the great movie monsters for a modern audience."
1," Even if the turn takes the film off the rails, ""Nasty Baby"" is a very well-made going off the rails that is a piece of the world that has been created. "
1," As von Trier seeks our own understanding & sympathy, the question he keeps provocatively posing is not only whether Jack's work can be considered art, but also how different von Trier's own art, showing us humanity & life in negative, is from Jack's."
0, Your heart can't help but be moved. Your brain can't help but groan.
0, You won't find anything startling or memorable.
0, It's a lazy effort that offers little encouragement for the future of Schwimmer's directorial career.
1," Zvyagintsev deploys the voluptuousness of his camera, avoiding the mechanisms of intrigue, to describe these increasingly internalized behaviors. [Full Review in Spanish] "
0," Although he'd have made a crackerjack ad man, [Moore's] a slipshod filmmaker, and the movie quickly collapses, burying its subject beneath bumper-sticker rehashes of received ideas."
0, Seemingly pieced together by spare parts and competing ideas.
0," From the swelling melody on the soundtrack that opens the film to the Wind Beneath My Wings-like ballad that closes it, Winnie Mandela ... feels less like history come alive than Hollywood hagiography at its most blandly sentimental."
0," Almost funny enough to be entertaining, but not quite."
1," A warm drama that drifts into light, goofy comedy, this film is too slight to be a classic, but its subtly sharp-edged script holds our interest and gives the cast something to work with. "
0," Jennifer's Body is a tragic desecration of mammoth talent that'll serve as an arresting step back in the buoyant career of Oscar-winning Juno scribe Diablo Cody. Plus it needed a sexpot who could act, too, and Megan Fox can't."
0," The actors are fine, though the drab screenplay does them no favours."
0," The cliched plot and terrible dialogue make this so-called ""thriller"" nearly unbearable."
0," The couple's doomed romance feels familiar from numerous other films about addiction, and the movie is downright bad whenever it aspires to visual poetry."
0," Way too much psychosexual melodrama, portrayed in performances that range from utterly bored (Jackson) to embarrassingly broad (Kirby)."
1, No matter how stylized the surroundings ... Haynes treats his characters with a tenderness and sympathy that is anything but sarcastic.
0," Criminal acts and scenes of brutal violence spoil the effect of ""Barnyard"" as an animated movie for tots."
1, Anybody who expects this film to be nothing more than the equivalent of flipping through the advertisements in a slick magazine is in for a surprise.
0," You have to wonder how long Smith plans to hang out in front of the big-screen Quick Stop, telling the same kind of jokes and copping the same old attitudes."
0," Watch ""fail"" compilation videos on YouTube... It'll make you laugh more than this movie can."

1," Low-budget with a subtle script and real, rounded characters."
1," A work of gentle, continual hilarity that feels far more ordinary than other Coen works and yet has every bit of the originality and exactness that makes the brothers' best films so wonderful."
1, The Barry Seal you see onscreen is the man Cruise wants you to see: a guy with limited skills and a lot of dumb luck. It's an energetic and convincing performance.
1," There is a great movie inside, burning to break free of the shackles of the writers"
1," Although Starsky & Hutch is a movie without a sincere moment, somehow it never seems cynical."
0, ...essentially just one long chase sequence that becomes much too monotonous much too soon.
1," Frida's gaze governs everything, taking you back to the mysteries, the insecurities - and the joys - of being six."
0," When it comes down to fourth and goal, the movie is more about moving the pigskin than moving the audience."
0, The movie provides its own answer as to why the original Stooges' earlier projects were confined to two-reelers and shorts. Sometimes Moe is less.
0," Unpredictable and mildly engaging with decent performances, but suffers from an uneven balance of dark comedy, drama and satire with too much awkwardness and not enough bite."
1, A delightful and delicate comic fable.
1," A delightful exercise in wish-fulfillment, the picture is one of the most unashamedly romantic of Allen's career - if not the most - with hardly a trace of his cynical, caustic and darkly ironic take on the world."
0," The most emotionally authentic part of the film, by far, are the wedding snapshots that run with the end credits..."
0," It also isn't a film of light and dark. It's dark and then darker again, with no humour or sense of joy."
0, This is not the laugh riot that you might expect. Same goes for the fighting. There's certainly a lot less here than in the average Jackie Chan movie.
1, At last a Zombie film hits the big screen with humor and romance.
0," The best that can be said is that it's a 'cute' and 'harmless' kids' movie, as long as you ignore the moment when Yogi tells the lovestruck Mr. Ranger that the best way to woo a mate is to urinate on her. "
1," If you've ever installed a v-chip in your family tellie, Land of the Dead may not be for you"
0," For all the pretty people and prettier costumes stuffed into the film, [Coppola] has left a blank emotional slate on which moviegoers can Etch-a-Sketch any version they like."
0, A testament to the perils of facile digital editing.
1, Shrug however you might at a story that has to pack so many characters and tangents into 140 minutes; it will still be difficult for me to see beyond the joyous awesomeness.
1," This exquisitely assembled film, driven by Larrain's pin-sharp direction and Bernal's rousing performance, turns a potentially dry subject into something uproariously funny and massively involving."
1," Aliens never strives to be as accomplished as the original, but it's wit and turbo-charged battles make it a wild and electric ride, one with the best replay value of the franchise."
0," Tony Goldwyn's Conviction tells a great story that deserves a great movie, but settles for a mediocre one."
0," ""The Adjustment Bureau"" is what ""Inception"" might have been like if it were written by Nicholas Sparks."
0," The Devil Inside joins a long, woozy-camera parade of found-footage scare pictures, among them The Blair Witch Project, the Paranormal Activity films and certain wedding videos that won't go away."
1, ...a film that derives its tone from the Northwest coast that seeps into the characters who live there.
1, The kind of movie you just don't see these days -- an intelligently crafted entertainment that pretends to be nothing more. 
0, ...a misbegotten endeavor that's as pointless as it is infuriating. 
1, The Lost Boys a perfect conglomeration of scary and fun.
1, A fitting conclusion to Jackson's prequel trilogy and a triumphant adieu to Middle-earth.
1, A celebration of just how unbelievably awesome it is to make rock music for a living - not to mention being so successful at it that you can get your childhood heroes to come over and jam.
0," Russell is so enamored with the period pizzazz - the outrageous hairstyles and outfits, the strobe-lit clubs, the yellows and browns - that the movie flatlines."
1, Final installment still far cry from 70s pics.
1," Imagine Belle And Sebastian remaking In The Mood For Love as a heartbreaking low-fi musical, and you have a fair approximation of the film's melancholy, unexpected genius."
1, A winningly sharp Millennial riff on the greens of summer.
1," A touching, pawkily amusing example of that fairly rare genre, the satirical tragedy."
1, ...the movie still has the power to floor you with its stunning sounds and imagery.
0, Miss Sloane's flashy yet witless repartee suggests profundity yet exposes nothing. 
0," The film is always fun, but as Carroll might have observed, it's not much of a muchness."
1," Del Toro also dedicates himself, professing his affection and admiration for cinema, paying homage, but very much in his own style. [Full Review in Spanish] "
1, There's enough of the all-out V.C. Andrews flavor to make this installment worth a look for those who want to catch up with a family of soap people 30 years in the making.
1, ... akin to a 'blockbuster of the mind'
1, An entertaining and wholly original genre hybrid film that has more than a few tricks up its sleeves.
1, Nearly matches the original in charm and kicks.
1," For long stretches, it appears to be a road movie headed nowhere. Still, the detours it uncovers are fascinating."
0," If you think a thick, juicy slab of Civil War history can't be boiled down to 145 minutes of speechifying, stultifying cinema, then grab a seat. Even McConaughey is sucked dry of his usual acting panache. "
0, You can see every single twist and turn of the plot coming at you from 10 miles away.
1, A beautifully crafted yet equally disturbing thriller.
0, A teen comedy that views sex as an all-you-can-gorge buffet.
0, You can see where this is going all the way from Duluth.
0, Less scary than landing in jail while playing Monopoly.
0," Manderlay loses in power what it lacks in novelty, even though it's more relevant than anything the year is likely to bring."
0," Aside from depicting American academia as a cutthroat environment that can inspire deadly resentment, there's not much going on."
1, An incisive portrait of a troubled eccentric that manages to be both broadly uplifting and quirkily entertaining.
0, (The Farrelly Brothers) have a tendency to rely on good gags to prop up shopworn storytelling.
1," It is escapist entertainment in the hottest, most illusion-driven, fastest, tumultuous action style, bridging genres with ease (one-against-the-system/sci fi/film noir/action/apocalyptic fable) and creating its own style in the process."
0," Unfortunately, the interest of immediacy of the conversation seems to trump thorough journalism."
1," Cars zoom, guns blaze, and the quips fly with wild abandon, but the biggest achievement to be found here is the pairing of Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson. About effing time. "
1," For the most part, however, the movie strikes its own great tone, mixing the anxious comedy of realistically awkward romantic exchanges with Rebel Wilson's more over-the-top but effectively comic antics."
1," Kore-eda films aren't sexy or controversial, but in their small, observational ways offer unexpectedly complete emotional journeys. When they're over, you feel like you've been somewhere."

1, This Rapunzel's got sand.
1," Every once in a while, a movie is so heartbreaking even a tough guy like Chuck Norris or Simon Cowell will break out into tears."
0, On Chesil Beach doesn't quite rise up to to the level of previous adaptations of Ian McEwan's works.
0," Frankly, Real Steel is an appalling movie: cliched, corny, sentimental, hectoring and pitched so low that the term B-movie seems like praise. "
0," Apart from the interesting premise and the novelty of seeing so many famous cartoon characters together on the screen, I was overall disappointed and it completely failed to live up to my memory."
1," Proof that horror, when handled properly, is a genre with great richness and the capacity to make you reflect upon different subjects using fear as a conduit. [Full review in Spanish]"
1," A well-acted and vivid re-creation of a dark, downbeat era when ""girls don't play electric guitar,"" and you had to be someone pretty tough and pretty special to try it."
1," If you are an ""X"" maniac, Singer's given you the movie you've been hoping for."
1, Both moving on its own terms and an invigorating conversation-starter...
1," A great, suspenseful film from director Andrei Konchalovsky before he went Hollywood and on to junk like Tango and Cash."
1," Warm Bodies is an ingenious hybrid that, at its best, manages to be funny, lyrical and gruesome."
1," Credit should also go to the fierce-eyed Youngblood and Hernandez for making their onscreen relationship so believable. And youngster Baez is completely natural, which is even more incredible when you consider that he's speaking an ancient language."
1," The Man From U.N.C.L.E. isn't about much, but it made me smile for a while. It's harmless fun."
1, A film that can make you laugh without making you feel anything ... except maybe a little weariness for self-consciously quirky movies about unusual loners.
1," The living conditions it projects are as horrendous as I had feared, but the movie is surprisingly easy to take as a rollicking homicidal entertainment."
0, Parental Content Review
0," It's such a colorless creation, it's almost impossible to believe Niccol botched his weird idea so quickly, turning something with serious potential for lively sci-fi escapism into a miserable, static motion picture."
0," In the end, it's a miserable movie about miserable people, and we're left to wonder why. But any further time spent considering this forgettable romance feels wasted."
1," At its best, it's chilling, creepy, strange and intriguing; at its worst, it's gorgeous to look at."
1," Genre fans will enjoy the escalating mayhem and some moments of inventive, audacious grisliness."
0," The film does everything that teen horror flicks are supposed to do, but Hilton undermines it all by not even trying to act."
0," Sooner or later, you have to serve up something more compelling than an abattoir. For Wolf Creek 2, that's the only purpose of the exercise."
1," The three leads are all splendid, especially Weisz."
0," Blomkamp never shows authority with anything besides the fluid Chappie visual effects, biting off more than he can chew with this unpleasant, muddled, and unsatisfying actioner."
1," Part of ""21's"" problem as it ups its stakes is that it's about as dangerous and sexy as a $1-minimum keno game. But it's still a mildly tantalizing timewaster about wish fulfillment told with casual confidence before a dragging finale."
1," It's the film's tone and the screen charisma of Robert Downey Jnr that makes this big, bold action filled sequel such a blast"
0," With a running time of almost three slow-going hours, the movie definitely makes you feel as though you're aging forward."
1, No director has done more to chronicle change in contemporary China and the instability it breeds in the lives and livelihoods of ordinary people. Yet there's a foreground/background problem that continues to plague his work ...

1," In 2015, I marveled at the very existence of a movie that championed good manners and kindness, but I had no idea how much more those things would matter in 2018. "
0," Suicide Squad continues with more of a whimper than a bang, lurching from one so-so set piece to another with the occasional token gesture towards character development."

1," There's tears to fill a tide pool, wit to keep adults amused and laughs for any audience with a short attention span."
0, Self-serving and juvenile.
0," Who will make these arrests and when? It's hard to develop an intense involvement around the question, and heading toward the who-cares resolution are lots of scenes paced with maddening slowness."
0," The acting is strong but the story isn't, especially the almost laughable 'let me leave you a note' situation at the end."
1," A compelling, sometimes funny, sometimes poignant dramatization of the behind-the-scenes machinations of the Republican side of the 2008 presidential campaign that is unlikely to sway already entrenched opinions on both sides."
0," It's a tired opinion, but Seth MacFarlane really does only appeal to fans of Seth MacFarlane... of which, I imagine the number one fan is Seth MacFarlane."

1," Gaga is appealing, open and down-to-earth in her first major role."
1," The fantastical landscape of the film is also forgiving of its flaws, as any shortcomings in the script or direction simply feed into the sense of things being not as they should be."
1," Even if you have no idea who Tab Hunter is, this documentary is riveting and insightful."
1," What's so powerful about the film is the rich stories it tells and how it leads them like so many human tributaries to one black, bubbling source."
0, I'm not even fully confident in calling it a movie.
1, Gangs...could eat Charles Dickens' Oliver Twist for lunch and have the Artful Dodger turning tricks by sundown.

0," In the stacked-deck world of Robert Eisele's script, this team has an uncanny ability to grab the hindsight-friendly side of every issue."
1, Deserves no small amount of credit for being an absolute delight... and for never acting like the viewer is an idiot even as it never requires that the viewer be a genius.
1, This quietly unnerving psychological study from German director Hans-Christian Schmid wields its ambiguity about religion and science like a double-edged blade.
1, ... a genuinely touching outcome. [Full review in Spanish]
0," With its edges sandpapered smooth, the story about an affable loser discovering he has fathered 533 children is rendered ludicrously feel-good and nonsensical."
0," Filled with lame Niqab jokes that could have been lifted out of ISHTAR, or a bad episode of FAMILY GUY."
0," Often, ""The Lego Ninjago Movie"" feels like it's obeying the conventions of throwaway entertainment when it should be making more of an effort to comment on it."
0, [Truth or Dare] swings between the predictable and the ridiculous.
0, The under-imagined characters have the effect of dulling out one's interest in them -- fatal to a story that depends on engendering our emotional involvement to make the tearjerking moments land effectively.
1," Unsurprisingly, there is ample philosophical and political meat to Eye In The Sky. As a crisis drama it also scores highly, rotating from one set to the next and linking the tense energies and tones of a superb cast."
0," The film has potential, but ultimately there's more bark than bite."
0," Donkey Punch is almost humorless, and there's no wink and nudge behind the mayhem to absolve us of taking its ugly, class-obsessed subtext seriously."
1," ""War for the Planet of the Apes"" is easily one of the year's best films. ... a truly exciting and superior cinematic adventure."
1, Lupita Nyong'o turns in the best performance in her career and Jordan Peele shows off his technical prowess in an otherwise uneven film with no clear emotional center
1," It isn't a perfect film, but Montage of Heck's portrayal of Kurt Cobain should be commended for its honesty."

1," More a comedy than a romantic tale, this movie is decked out with hilarious side roles."
0, Merely uses innovative means to tell a trite story.
0," When audience members cheer for the ferocious killers-on-the-rampage, it really makes you wonder about our cultural values today - and society in general."
1, An experience audiences are unlikely to forget.
0, A teen movie so inspirational and heartwarming that it comes with its very own lip gloss.
1, It's in the quieter moments where the light of truth shines brightest. 
0, Akin to exhuming a once good-looking corpse; wholly unnecessary - and a bit of a mess.
0," Drama has been mugged by melodrama. Posturing nihilism powers on, fatuously fantasticated whenever the realist impulse, feeble at best, flickers out altogether."
1," A bold, unique, exquisite gem."
0, Traffik is a thriller that takes its sweet time getting to the thrills...
0," Had Confessions been truer to its chick-lit novel inspiration, the movie could have been fizzily enjoyable instead of sickening."
1," Sicko may not be Moore's best documentary to date, but it's most certainly his most important and entertaining one yet."

0," Ruben Fleischer's film is a perfect example of Hollywood hypocrisy, something to be ignored diligently."
0," Five minutes of Carano fighting, 85 minutes of half-baked espionage plotting that nobody, not writer Lem Dobbs or Soderbergh, seems to care much about."
0," ... what winds up in the picture's largely lazy grasp is largely evidence of the influence of, well, any number of cheap and often straight-to-video testosterone fests."
0, Clearly just the sum of its parts.
1," If the weather is a bit too warm for you right now, this should chill the blood just right."
1," A maddening movie that gives the viewer plenty to think about, but little to care about."
1," Rian Johnson is a very clever man, if sometimes a bit too clever for his own good."
1," Comic-Con Episode IV is a valentine to an event and a group of people so in ascension they don't really need it, but it's still a pleasant thing to watch."
1, The fact that the film deals with teenage pregnancy - and doesn't preach at all - is a feat of filmmaking.
1," For most of its running time, it's an enjoyably unpretentious celebration of the guilty pleasure we can take from a stupid-as-all-get-out car chase or from watching things blow up real good."
1," The gripping, intelligent directorial debut of TV personality Jon Stewart, who also wrote the screenplay, based on Bahari's post-prison memoir, ""Then They Came For Me."""
1," At once an overview of the crime-poverty cycle, a discomforting police procedural, and a re-sensitization to action-movie tropes, Bus 174 is one of the most thoughtful films of 2003"
0," I love this idea, but songs need hooks and melodies just as movies need plots and characters."
0, It's touching work that makes Dempsey's plastic sincerity look as thin as the film's posters.
0, Jigsaw is hollow genre exercise from a series that once dared to dip its toe into the health care debate.
1," Some of the plot turns seem a bit too convenient, and the film goes on for too long. But ultimately, it's a showcase for a pair of excellent actors who elevate the material."
0, A singularly unpleasant experience drenched in so much anger and frustration that the film almost becomes interesting. Almost.
1, We're not used to bad guys with redeeming qualities. And that makes Tsotsi as disquieting as it is intriguing.
1," ... a minor but impressive showpiece: crisply directed, smartly shot, handsomely mounted."
1," The animation is wonderful, leading to plenty of colorful visual gags and over-the-top situations."
1," Because of its outre subject of lesbianism and one sexually graphic scene, Aldrich's well acted, lurid melodrama was slapped with X-rating upon its release."
0," A story that should be savagely funny and tauntingly surreal, at least for part of its arc, drifts into problem-of-the-week terrain."
0," In spite of a few moving scenes, it's labored, too long and too gorgeously shot."
0," Goes for drippy, excruciating cuteness on the level of teddy bears who tickle you, tuck you in and sing you to sleep."
1," There's a lot to bite into here, but it's a film that doesn't always live up to its own dizzying potential."
1," Overall, the lack of resources soak the screen, but it adds to the film's grotesque charm. "
1," I liked Lawrence a lot, and Red Sparrow's ending does deliver."
0, Bunraku is everything from blatant ripoff to experimental cinema to a graphic novel gone wild with its bad acting and predictable ending.
1," Jen's own loneliness and gentle spirituality are deeply affecting. It is such a strange film in its way, stranger still if you are not accustomed to Weerasethakul's work, and it needs a real investment of attention. But there is something sublime in it."
1, ... Wilderpeople isn't just charming or good-it's a legitimately great film.
1," ""Before I Fall"" is a new take on an old film, reinventing itself for today's generation."
0, It's tone deaf at best and offensive imperialism at worst. Rock the Kasbah is revolting on every level.
0," A movie that is so ""by the numbers"" that you kind of feel bad for it. [Full review in Spanish]"
1," It's a film of breathtaking cinematic romanticism and near-complete denial of conventional catharsis. You might wish it gave you more in terms of comfort food pleasure, but that's not Anderson's problem."
0," [Non-Christians] will find this trudge through Jesus' childhood years laborious, even though it thankfully refrains from proselytising."
0, A pale imitation of its 1 and frisky predecessor.
0," Pathetic 'anti-romantic' comedy, revolving around a petulant jerk."
0, This movie is drowning in duty -- to say nothing of hoary storytelling devices and one embarrassing scene after the next for Sienna Miller as Mrs. Kyle.
0," Refn may have lent his name as an executive producer and his blessing to Spanish director Luis Prieto, but the inventiveness of the original is MIA."
1, It's not so much scary as spooky (except for one really creepy moment) but this ghost story is less about supernatural hauntings than human secrets and lies.
1, Fiennes' abusive romance makes visible the hidden hypocrisies of the Victorian age.
1, A spectacular demonstration of what modern technology can contribute to dramatic storytelling.
1," Secret Santa is the holiday horror film to watch when you want to see a family that is more dysfunctional than your own. It is equal parts carnage and laughs, with outrageous characters that have you laughing and screaming from start to finish. "
0," ... neither witty nor insightful in its comic observations, instead relying on low-brow gags and stereotypes out of desperation."
1," An agreeable period romp, missing the spark of the high-end Austen adaptations but firmly in command of its own romantic devices."
0," An AIP beach movie; Gidget Goes Grecian or How To Stuff A Wild Souvlaki or Marital Beach Party. It's meant to be rollicking, cheesy, brain-dead good fun."
0, feels like something that should have been a whole lot better
0," The film never weaves together its various strands as tightly as the soundtrack does, and it's unlikely that those unfamiliar with the cultures of the Caribbean will understand where everyone is coming from."
1," The film examines, with wit and patience, the hard work of community-building - and the toll on someone far from home, doing work that's not his calling."

1, To say that Gilliam has repeated himself is to say that John Ford made Westerns.
0," The film is said to be based on the case files of a real-life cop-turned-demonologist. Instead, it seems to have been inspired by a stack of rejected horror-movie scripts found in a studio dumpster."
1," Mel Gibson's Apocalypto is, above all, a muscular and kinetic action movie, a drama of rescue and revenge with very little organic relation to its historical setting."
1," For her first feature, Australian actress-turned-filmmaker Jennifer Kent creates a startlingly effective horror movie by combining serious scariness with some darkly evocative emotion."
1," The various performances are all of an incredibly high standard, with some perhaps more inspired pieces of casting but others representing actors rising up to a reach a high bar. "
0, It's as cozy and self-congratulating as you'd expect from a thing executive-produced and distributed by Spacey.

0," There are some funny gags interspersed among the undistinguished ones, but Wang's direction has little snap or wit, and the movie overall is too fixated on the laborious task of massaging our universal self-esteem."
0, The comically-tinged suspense and technical brilliance of certain moments never grow out of anything organic as in the great Panahi/Kiarostami collaboration Crimson Gold.
0," Too bad, then, that any episode of Smackdown! packs a bigger wallop."
1," White-maned Meryl Streep is a lioness in winter, with a weary whisper for a roar."

1, Angst-riddled yet assured debut by third-generational filmmaker Gia Coppola.
0," The film goes nowhere, slowly, entangled in its own not-quite-funny, not-quite-touching, not-quite-anything romcom complications."
0," No point in labeling this a horror film. This is a sadism film, and while all good and great horror films know what sadism tastes like, a sadism film settles for nothing of lasting, imaginative horror."
1," Released on the 50th anniversary of the James Bond films, Skyfall is simultaneously one of the series' most rousing entries and one of its most vexing."
1," A thoroughly engaging story about fear and faith, which also happens to be a first-class hair-raiser from a moviemaker with a taste for the Hitchcockian tease."
1," Palmer and Bello really do seem like world-weary, spook-addled daughter and mother, and they play the stakes just so, favoring neither blase understatement nor yellow-highlighter melodrama."
1," A lush visual rendering of the Pennsylvania Dutch proverb, 'We get old too soon, and too late smart.'"
0, Something's Gotta Give is trite and overly cloying for its own good to the point that the pretentiousness factor is as jumpy as Nicholson's devilish facial expressions
1," An amusing, cynical black comedy about our national addiction to tragedy, and our commoditization of grief..."

1, Hazanavicius has reminded us of why we love the movies. He is sure to bring a smile to anyone who gambles on seeing this glorious throwback. 
0," Great actors Ben Mendelsohn and Rooney Mara do their best to elevate the frustrating Una, but their director doesn't seem to understand what he has in these two performers."
1," The film could have done with more finesse in the way it begins and ends, but there are enough subtle shifts in the main act to keep me with it. After Monsoon Wedding and The Namesake, The Reluctant Fundamentalist is [Mira] Nair's most engaging work."
1, The film turns a welcome spotlight on a resourceful and singular artist who was forced to do everything from scratch in the absence of any local industry infrastructure.
0, The storyline is so nonsensical that everything around it becomes a waste of time and effort.
1, This picture attempts to bring about a fuller understanding of sacrifice on the battlefield and in that respect it is a moving and dignified salute to the fallen.
1," You have been privy to a series of seductive, ephemeral moments, drawn into the eternal rhythm of youth and connected with something old and durable, one name for which is art."
0," A bittersweet relationship story presented in a glass case, with an accompanying music box, but it doesn't really earn this treatment."
0," This is one piece of derivative, hokey, and really stupid action drivel."
1," Sï¿½ï¿½nia Braga [gives] a magical, career-redefining performa"
1," Pollack drives this movie as if it's a well-tuned automobile, taking turns smoothly, accelerating at the right moments then easing off the gas pedal without ever losing momentum."
1," When wronged wife and crazy lady finally let loose on each other in the film's final scenes, Obsessed becomes a wildly campy and deliciously trashy must-see."
0, The ending is as baffling as anything preceding it - giving rise to a genre conflict situation.
1," My number one film of the year. Yes, it's that good. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Sexual Content, Profanity, etc. - also Available)"
1," The Dark Knight should not be remembered as the movie that took Heath Ledger out. Thanks primarily to him, it should be remembered as the movie that propelled fantasy action-thrillers to a higher level."
1," The set-ups are laborious and stupid and largely untenable, but the actors bring just enough emotion to the frame to make us care. Applegate is fantastic, and nothing short of inspiring as she bridges the gap between hot mama and mama bear..."
1," [Ajith is] fine form here. Playing a character that gives him the chance to be someone his age, here, he turns on the charms when he is with the heroines and taps into the coolly aggressive and self-possessed persona that we saw in Mankatha and Billa."
1," An engaging, light character comedy, played somewhere between the Ealing tradition and contempo regional comedy."
0, Looks like we have to add John Waters to the list of filmmakers who have run out of things to say.
0," ...by hanging its oddball characters on the most obvious of plots, it dilutes the weirdness that would have made it unique."
1," A lot of what it's trying to do is done better in the new ""Mission: Impossible"" but its music and its female lead make it distinctive."
1," Director Jason Hall digs deep into your core to show you exactly how veterans are treated, mistreated, used and abused by the very system they risk their lives to protect. "
0," There's a dark, acid-tongued comedy to be made from this premise with these characters, but this bland ""Teacher"" just isn't bad enough."
0," I began hating it not just for its utter lack of quality as art or entertainment, but for the blackness of its very soul."
1," As cop/crime dramas go, this one offers little that's new but it takes the time to develop the characters and that's where its strengths lie."
0," The Inevitable Defeat of Mister & Pete simply tries too hard, and its emotional manipulation becomes far too obvious."
0," These guys set out to make a movie where they could crack each other up. At this late date, they can't even manage that."
0," This coming-of-age comedy/drama rings emotionally false during many of its jacked-up, stacked-deck emotional confrontations and mistakes obnoxiousness for personality in almost every adult character."

0, Does it work as an ordinary movie? Not really. But I'm not sure it'll work in HFR either.
0," Zahler's commitment to objective realism, despite his out-there premise, denies the audience the sort of engagement that might have made Bone Tomahawk truly subversive, and truly great."
0," Without core chemistry, the already flimsy plot is unbelievable. Without any sexual tension, the fate of the Hudson-Dillon marriage is irrelevant. Without any reason for Wilson to cut up and caper, why watch him do it?"
0, Too much blurry cinematography and indecipherable whispering made 'Marie Antoinette' the most annoying film I've seen since 'Miami Vice.'
1," One of Woody's best, this is a good place to start if you're unfamiliar with his body of work. It's funny, it's dramatic, and it's certainly the best looking film he's ever made. The opening sequence is tremendous."
0," I laughed here and there at She's Out of My League, but I sort of hated everything it had to say about nerds and babes and the sliding scale of self-image."
1," Jennifer Kent's feature is beautifully made and cleverly filmed and paced. It's one of the most satisfying horror films I've seen in a while, and ends on a re1ingly original note."
0, [The romance is] an awkward afterthought to an already sluggish adventure story.
0," Once the protagonist's friends enter the punk world, the film falls apart. [Full Review in Spanish]"
0," This new franchise is supposed to be comprised of five movies. Consider ""Fantastic Beasts"" an awkward introduction. Perhaps when we get to know Newt better, we will embrace him more closely."
1, The Stoning of Soraya M. is an important film that needs to be watched - especially considering the current world political climate.
0, Not even close to the level of its predecessor. [Full Review in Spanish] 
0," Uninspired despite its various attempts to find inspiration, Magorium is itself like a toy: Shiny, mystifying and completely expendable."
1," With layers of meaning, this offbeat documentary by James Franco and Travis Mathews (I Want Your Love) provokes viewers as we watch its ideas challenge the people who are on-screen. "
1," n Summer Hours, Olivier Assayas's gently provocative rumination on family and possessions, a trio of siblings wrestles with the problem of what to do with the old homestead once Mother is gone."
0," Armed with an idiotic lead, a rambling unfocused story, and an ending transparent enough to make the audience laugh out loud at the screen."
0, Sizzling chemistry cannot overcome the banal script.
1," While it may not make you jump out of your seat in terror, Nancy will send chills down your spine in its own cold and calculating way."
1," In some ways, 12 Monkeys is the end-of-the-world thriller that Kathryn Bigelow's Strange Days wanted to be."
1, The Death of Stalin is a breath of 1 air and a genuinely great screen comedy. Iannucci conducts the proceedings like the conductor of a great orchestra with an array of virtuosos at his command. 
0, Tammy is a waste of a fine cast and a waste of everyone's time.
1," Sweet, Funny, Different"
1, This unexpectedly charming animation bursts out of the screen with an aesthetic that is a sugar rush of cuteness.

0," Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip is terrible for adults, and exposing your kids to this money-grab will not make them any smarter."
0," Altogether a shambles, and perhaps uniquely in the Coward canon, it features not a single laugh."
1, Jacquot's strategy allows his cast the benefit of being able to give full performances ... while demonstrating vividly that the beauty and power of the opera reside primarily in the music itself.
1," A story of filth and fury and, eventually, of placidity and peace, Her Smell is Alex Ross Perry's most chaotic and unmuffled filmï¿½ï¿½ï¿½until it "
0," The work of a man who needs to do everything in excess - lengthy battles, an absurd amount of low angle shots, painfully blatant product placement, pyrotechnics overload and well over two hours of CGI porn."
1," It's a mess too, but it's far more defensible as a lazy Sunday lark for those who have just recently outgrown action figures."
0," The more dramatic the material, the more restrained the approach ought to be."
1," If you don't already consider 'Clapton is God', as the famous graffiti put it, then you'll be unconverted by this oddly distancing rock doc...Diverting enough, it nonetheless fails to fully delve into its subject."
0," As a keen fan of black comedy, I was expecting a knockout, but it turns out to be a slap with a wet lettuce leaf."
1, Both Hawke and Byrne give deeply felt performances.
0," This Means War seems so concerned with being the best product, it doesn't even know how to be good trash."
1," It's the little moments that annihilate us, every day, every normal day. Days that don't end, days when the end of the world is a comfort that the sick like Justine cannot afford."
1," Delightful, uplifting Swedish comedy that marks a long-awaited return to the form ... for writer-director Lukas Moodysson, thanks to a warm-hearted, witty script and a trio of terrific performances from its three young leads."
0," The film itself is caked with voice-over directives -- we're actually told, for instance, what Angel and Nene look like at the very moment they're in celestially lit close-up."
1, A happy surprise!
0, Stoppard and Wright's version is rich with artifice
1," Being Elmo: A Puppeteer's Journey"" is the story of a young man who knew what he wanted to do and did it, who made his dreams real. This may be the most truly American movie in memory."
1," Directed with zest by Mike Mitchell (from a script by Josh Klausner and Darren Lemke) and shot in 3D, this final Shrek sequel has plenty of verve."
1," ... the kind of deliberately stylish espionage yarn that Ingmar Bergman and Orson Welles might have agree upon, had they been predisposed to such foolishness."
1," Although his movie may be flabby in places, it's should also be an eye-opener, especially for blind proponents of American exceptionalism -- probably the people least likely to give the movie, and Moore, a fair shot."
1, Cameron Crowe has made a heartfelt piece of work that stands among his best: a love song to anyone who ever wanted to be cool...and never quite found their way.
1, The film is worth seeing for the performance alone.
0, From the novelist who spawned Death Wish (1974) comes another story of vigilante justice that'll make you want to hurt someone. Anyone.
1," Amid a plethora of tired summertime movie sequels, Incredibles 2 stands out. Fourteen years in the making, Incredibles 2 is a superhero movie critiquing what it means to believe in superheroes."
1," Byrne walks away with the film by making Kelly a well-rounded, conflicted person, rather than the film's fun cop who has to tell everyone the boring truth. "
0, Perhaps the most misogynistic film of the decade.
0," Lazy, lame and painfully unfunny."
1," Here's the date movie of the year, about a first 1989 date between Barack Obama (Parker Sawyers) and Michelle Robinson (Tika Sumpter). Both actors are terrific, suggesting the powerhouses they're playing without undue mimickry. "
0," Fun With Dick & Jane offers the faintly depressing sight of Jim Carrey, like Dick Harper, doing whatever it takes to earn his supper."
1, Aerosmith's Steven Tyler is an elf? How cool is that!?
1," The movie is a mess, an unfettered explosion of ideas one wishes had been more carefully crafted. And yet the ideas that land land like a megaton bomb."
1, Babbit's flair for menace and allure can't be dismissed; nor can the magnetism of Cuthbert and Belle.
1, Great fun to watch -- and not just for kids.
0, 'W.' never quite reaches its presidential potential.
0, It was hard to shake the worry that a fizzy comedy about debt would be about as wrong for our current woes as uncorking a bottle of champagne. Confessions is definitely slight.
1, I'd say that as a whole this was a successful project by Eli Roth. There are obviously aspects of the film that did not work within the context of the story.
1, Anyone still doubting that the Claymation studio behind Wallace and Gromit deserves a seat at the grown-ups' table only needs to see its pitch-perfect collaboration with author-screenwriter Gideon Defoe...
1, In a way it seems like a parody of a [Paul] Greengrass film: His cameras shake and the music swells but the narrative is stuck in neutral for a good hour-plus. It's all herky-jerked up with nowhere to go.
1," ""Joshy"" fairly accurately captures the way guys at play mock and tease each other while avoiding seriousness at all costs, and Baena additionally manages to give each character enough space to make a mark on his own."
0, Suffers mainly from simplicity.
0," Near the end of the film, it was also very obvious that they had either run out of time or budget since the movie started looking like a video game cut scene."
0, Terribly lame humour don't help.
0," Antibirth has so many moments that flash what Danny Perez is capable of, but none of them come together in the end."
1," It's like Larry Clark with stakes, with a beating heart, or Harmony Korine with candor instead of vaudeville. Whatever the mix of truth to fiction, a sense of authenticity pervades each gesture."
1," There's little originality in the joy rides, first kisses, and clashes with bullies, yet this 2005 debut feature by writer-director Michael Kang captures the small triumphs of a boy becoming a man."
1," Eye-opening, ire-raising...an important account of a disastrous situation. One of the five best documentaries of 2011."
1, What They Had throws a spotlight on a life altering experience for three generations faced with placing a loved one in a 'memory home' or continuing to make her life comfortable just as it is breaks your heart.
0, We begin with old Super 8 footage of a family hanging from a tree which is either a terrible tragedy or a natural outcome of the average Disney vacation.
0, ...a movie with its heart in the right place and its computers heading off in all different directions.
1," The Muppet legacy is in no way sullied, but the over-the-moon magic is missing. They should try Hare Krishna."

0," So loud, so long, so dumb."
1," Towelhead isn't a movie, it's a loaded gun."
0, Only the children manage to survive it. The adults are totally plastic throughout.
0, Confessional moments and life lessons pop up around every corner as the movie swaps reality for old-fashioned melodrama. The movie defies logic.
1," There are so many things I like about Life, Above All that I'm willing to forgive its minor flaws..."
0," Embarking upon this seemingly endless, dot-to-dot like quest of flat and laborious special effect driven events, we fall victim further still to the franchise's ever growing, deluded and cocksure array of purportedly endearing characters."
1," It's everything a doc should be: Informative, funny, touching and ending with Canada spanking the US."
0," The Circle is a movie that is emotionally dead, intellectually vapid, and otherwise just dull. It doesn't even have the decency to be so bad that its failing is amusing."
1," An instant classic twelve years in the making, striking in its tender tone and stunning in its cumulative emotional impact."
1," Takes what I believe is one of the most realistic approaches to cancer and cancer treatment you'll see on screen, but remembers to treat its potentially delicate subject matter with a blunt sense of humor. "
1," Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs works on its own terms, as a distraction for the children and an inoffensive, if unfulfilling, time at the theater for their parents."
1, The evident affection for this romanticized vision of the era saturates the film like the warm sepia tones of its palette.
0," It's all about the gimmick, and 24 Hours to Live doesn't even buy into that with much conviction."
1," The movie gets by on sheer exuberance. Your appreciation of it, I suspect, will strongly depend on your mood and the enthusiasm of the audience members around you."
0," This movie tries to cash in on the current 80s nostalgia craze...there are ways to do the nostalgia thing and make it stylistic, but this one flew a bit too close to the sun and burned its wings."
0," ""The Choice"" is the 11th feature film to be adapted from a novel by bestselling author Nicholas Sparks. They should have stopped at No. 10."
0," It's sad to see Hanks, who usually tackles any role with such earnest enthusiasm, phoning it in, though I suppose it's to his credit that he can't quite seem to take Langdon seriously."
0, Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe have stripped the fantasy away from Robin Hood and replaced it with ... boring.
0," Everything, Everything has the style to draw in fans of the Young Adult genre, but it lacks the substance to truly resonate when compared to other (better) YA films."
1," Soderbergh and screenwriter Coleman Hough aren't interested in creating a coy whodunit so much as evoking the deeper, less romantic mysteries of people -- and it's riveting."
0, Let the 2010 Razzies race begin!
0," As yet another nostalgic live-action treatment of an old television cartoon series, George of the Jungle didn't have much going for it."
0," Even at its most involving, though, Christine never quite banishes the nagging question one might have about what the ultimate point of this whole enterprise is."
0, The film suffers from pacing problems and an unfortunate usage of its female lead. 
1, A quietly observed Chekhovian drama about the effects of globalization on a French family.
0, The urban Parisian locales form an intriguing backdrop for an otherwise formulaic action thriller.
1," This lethally brutal exercise in Indonesian martial-arts mayhem - featuring the charismatic Iko Uwais (""The Raid"" franchise), a living, breathing action figure - is definitely not for the squeamish nor anyone who has just eaten lunch."
0," The director seems maybe a little too careful when it comes to putting the truth out there, like he doesn't want to offend anyone. Ironically, the movie is about a musical group that had no problem doing the opposite. [Full review in Spanish]"
1," Featuring some playfully deranged fantasy and flashback sequences to compliment what is overall sober, superior horror, this budding auteur of the macabre is hitting his groove."
0," Dolezal is basically outrage clickbait in human form, and so Brownson is using Dolezal's negative attention seeking to get attention for herself as a filmmaker. Nothing beyond that has been accomplished here."
0," Given enough popcorn, kids should find it diverting; adults may be less than enthralled."
1, A tense and nasty black-box thriller that conveys its politics through the microcosmic stakes of its life-and-death scenario.
1, A portrait of the poignant and strange mysteries of the creative process. 
0," Superficial, unauthorized drama about writer's rise to fame."
1," Affleck delivers another potent, serious-minded slice of pulp set on Boston's meanest streets, where loyalty among thieves runs thicker than blood."
0," The most groan-worthy Bay moment comes early on when Megan Fox's journalist, April O'Neal, manages to find some reasoning to dress up like a nerd girl in a porn skit and a school girl with a hiked-up kilt--all in one scene."
0," As a kinda raunchy, kinda endearing popcorn flick, there's stuff to enjoy about ""Long Shot."" By dressing up like a movie trying to make a point, though, it just ends looking like an empty suit at its own podium."
1, Offbeat live-action/animation mix with lots of drinking.
0, Boys must think audiences are not very bright.
1, A respectable addition to the King cinematic canon.
1," When it comes to making a Top 10 list for 2001, one title I won't forget is Memento."
1," There is no doubt that this drama is a half-hour too long and slow-moving, but Jolie and Pitt do some of their best work in scenes here -- and they don't hold back."
0," If watching cartoon characters spout four-letter words is your thing, this might well be the greatest movie ever made. "

1," The film's heart is in the right place, and it serves as a sweet antidote to the slick, computer animated family entertainment of the now, so be sure to grab a child and check it out on the big screen."

1, Tony Kaye's excellent drama features a killer performance by Adrien Brody.
0," You might not imagine Guy Ritchie's ""King Arthur"" could be so very Guy Ritchie."
1," This one was done by the aptly named Olivier Megaton, and he's done well with his brief, which requires him to keep the action flowing seamlessly and preposterously while showing off as many tourist sites as possible. "

0," An incomprehensible mess, held together only by the elaborate stunt of having the same actors play wildly divergent roles in each story. "
0, So little of real consequence is at stake that you'll have plenty of time to notice how the names on not one but two tombstones are misspelled.
0, Technically brilliant - but pathetically ignorant.
0, Furry Vengeance is a collection of feeble jokes in the service of green themes. Sustainability never looked so stupid.
0, It's all payoff and no setup; the longest Kodak commercial ever filmed.
1," Marshall uses the same formula of blending together multiple story lines for his light comedy Mother's Day, but this time has better defined the plot and embraced the emotion. It's not perfect, but it's a sweet Mother's Day gift."
1," The kung fu scenes overflow with crisp, thrilling and funny moments that whiz by in the 88-minute run time."
1," We Are Monster deserves note for its spirited rejection of the obvious, naturalistic narrative path, and Simon Richards' cinematography has considerable style and elegance."
0," I suspect that Ascher's intention was to dynamize an academic exercise, but these constant, sundry inserts render the tone as corny and glib as a VH1 special."
1," Charles Chaplin's 1952 film is overlong, visually flat, episodically constructed, and a masterpiece."

1," In his return to the big screen after a 10-year time out, Gibson gives us a slow-build to an extended rush of intensity, emotion and inspiration."

1," Moonlight was always going to be a hard act to follow, but Barry Jenkins has done it, delivering a warm, exquisite and heartbreaking movie"
1," Audiences used to having everything spelled out for them may find the film too much work, but there are, I hope and believe, many people who appreciate and enjoy unraveling the mysteries of a poem or painting for themselves."
0, It's little wonder the movie spends so much time running in circles when we see where it ultimately goes.
1," Zemeckis employs the same motion-capture technology that he first used in The Polar Express, to slightly better effect."
0," The film rarely maintains an image for more than a few seconds. Everything must be rapid, colorful and artsy, but it is an intellectual sham."
0, Would I see it again? I may never go to any Shyamalama-ding-dong movie again. 
0," And somehow Seagal is the best actor in it, which I mean in exactly the way you think I do."
0," The concise length partially mitigates the failings, but ultimately this is a Saw knock-off in camo gear."
1," An easy and enjoyable watch, thanks to Beatty's performance and eye - but a muddled one."
1," Una comedia fresca, inteligente y tierna que aborda temas delicados de manera desdramatizada e irï¿½ï¿½nica. Excelente elenco (empezando por la increï¿½ï¿½ble Ellen Page) y banda"
1," As recounted in Mark Hartley's entertaining documentary, twisted imaginations went wild after the post-'60s liberation from censorship and the introduction of tax breaks."
0," As the proceedings briskly fly, the silliness of the entire endeavor becomes more readily apparent."
0," Credit Illegal Tender for actually taking time to tell a story, though the lack of momentum sometimes makes the movie feel like a two-hour slow motion sequence."
1, What makes the movie more than a well-designed curiosity is its theme of how humanity can be swallowed by technology.
1," Moon is a small film but it effectively and credibly captures the beauty, melancholy and eeriness of space while telling a surprisingly human story."
1," While Anywhere But Here doesn't offer anything new in terms of mother-daughter relationship vehicles, it does bolster embracing performances from Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman."
0," There is too much ambition on display for the film to be completely dismissed, but good intentions carry Repo! only partway toward success."
0," At best, it angrily demands to be rechristened This Is It! Too often, however, an incredulous This Is It? seems more apt."
1, A sublimely moving and aesthetically rigorous experience overflowing with universally recognizable situations and characters.
1," This is an utterly compelling insight into modern history, psychology, international politics and boardgame warfare."
0, [A] watchable but thematically repetitive drama about Welsh poet Dylan Thomas' arrival in America in 1950.
0," This uninspiring film, starring Elle Fanning, Naomi Watts, and Susan Sarandon, struggles to find what it wants to say, probably because it doesn't even know what to call itself."
0," With its share of haunting imagery, it's sporadically unsettling but never truly frightening."
1," Considering how our preview screening audience -- comprised of 99% giddy female tweens and young teens -- reacted when the lights went down and this 3D film started, there could be gold in them thar boy band hills(Full Parental Review also available)"
1," Warm Bodies successfully unearths the ""human"" in budding relationships - and does it with the not-quite-human."
1, Insidious: Chapter 3 offers a relatable young protagonist and several key supporting players from the prior films in a nimble setup to the series.
1, Kawasi builds on the simple metaphorical significance of the set-up to tease out a much deeper and more compassionate study of the way our natural inclination to shun the marginalised in society diminishes us as a whole.
1," Goosebumps 2 is a lively and colourful ghost train ride, with some well-judged scares that would have been at home in its 1980s Amblin forerunners, such as The Goonies and Young Sherlock Holmes."
1," While the plot is sentimental and a little sticky, the dialogue is a lot of fun and often very witty and insightful."
0, Besson drags things out considerably for his young audience at 122 minutes. The CG work is clever but cannot measure up to Pixar's standards in cleverness or imagination. Nothing is 1 here.
0," The over-the-top destruction that follows seems all out of proportion to the misdeed, but then logic isn't the purpose of a film like this."
1," The film's title was chosen with care, because community judgement looms large in this film..."
1," The pleasure of this small, eccentric movie is the natural way Carano hurts people - by, say, walking partway up a wall and climbing onto a man's back, by sprinting toward the camera and flying into the human target standing in the foreground."
0," Unfortunately, Izzy fritters away much of its early promise and energy on a will-they-or-won't-they romantic plot that the film simultaneously indulges in and treats with contempt."
1," 'The Long Kiss Goodnight', 'La Femme Nikita', 'Kill Bill'... this South Korean thriller owes a debt to many a great female-assassin thriller, and it's a fun ride for fans of the genre. "
0, ...a generic by-the-numbers action thriller that has all the out-of-whack suspense of a defective dental drill...a desperate need to lend this rudimentary noisemaker some impulsive personality as well as credibility.
0," It sort of falls apart when we're supposed to start caring who dies. It's well-meaning to try to make them dimensional characters, but they are monster fodder."
1, I wasn't going to give Paranormal Activity 3 a very good review. Then I tried to sleep the night I saw it.
0," Well-meaning and decently put together, and it has occasional moments of charm...[but] more than a trifle stale."
1," [This] oddball odyssey stuck with me well after the final long, hypnotic shot of the magic train rolling through the Indian landscape."
1," I wish that this first release to show the artistic potential of the NC-17 rating was an undisputedly great film, not merely a brave and intriguing one."
1," Full of brilliantly captured candid moments, Older Than Ireland is a chirpy little charmer."
0," OK, I'll admit it: I've next to no idea what to make of Palindromes, and you know what? I doubt the filmmaker would have a problem with me owning up to it."
0," The action sequences alone are jaw dropping, heart racing affairs but flashy stunts and technical wizardry don't always support a story lacking in character development, therefore giving you minimal people to root for. "
0, Two and a half hours I'll never get back...
1," This enjoyable but dialogue-heavy addition to the Godzilla family takes aim at the inert, top-heavy bureaucracy of Japanese government."
1," I haven't cried in the cinema as much as I did during Me Before You in a long, long time."
1," Ex Machina is worth watching just as an exercise in suspense, creepy high-tech production design, and excellent acting."
0, We come looking for bravado and butt kicking...we end up with little more than dialogue and discussion. 
1, As a directorial debut the film is little short of astounding. It gives us one more reason to never forget.
1," It wouldn't work as well as it does if Hammer and Depp didn't play off one another as well as they do. But work it does, in a sort of shambling, Frankenstein manner that seems like it should fall apart at any moment but doesn't."
1," Heartstrings will be tugged and ribs tickled, particularly thanks to Cedric the Entertainer."
0, The new Earth is both too dumb and not quite dumb enough to be any fun at all.
1, The exuberant documentary Every Little Step revisits the genesis of the landmark show about the gestation and delivery of a Broadway musical.
1," Paris Square shows the contradictions, miseries and violence that inhabit the heart of today's society through a powerful history, with a discontinuous, fragmented, concrete plot, like the Brazilian reality itself. [Full Review in Spanish]"
1," The Wave has heart, laughs, and a big goddamn wave of destruction, and while we might have wanted more we don't actually need more. Enjoy it for what it is."

0, Here's what's wrong with giant movie screens: You can fill them with extreme close-ups of Robin Williams' face!
0," Scripted by Crank scribes Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor, and starring a game Josh Brolin, this probably looked good on paper."
1," Film is a powerful historian, especially one as compelling, dazzling and emotionally riveting as Control."
1, ...[a] devilishly dandy flesh-eating farce...uniquely hilarious and horrifying...Shaun and his cannibalistic cohorts will truly get under your skin.
1," Quirky, bizarre, different, and a hoot!"
0," What happens when Disney meets Jerry Bruckheimer? You get a whole new kind of rodent, but not necessarily a better one."
0," No one seems to have a clue about how to inject life into lifeless material...a cinematic meal of soft, bland fare only."
1," Somber and suspenseful, if self-indulgent, identity story about fathers and sins."
1, Daniel Day-Lewis reaches new acting heights as Lincoln while Sally Field matches him talent for talent as Mary Todd Lincoln.
1, A heartwarming and superbly-acted drama that hits all the right emotional notes.
0, The acting chemistry is exceptional but the movie misses a chance at a mature adult to teen connection. Instead we get John Cena's beer butt scene and two awkward sex scenes. 
0," Despite Coppola's obvious talents as a director, and her upscale style, her movie still plays like a TMZ report."
1," Enormously entertaining, enormously educational, and enormously moving."
0," What really should have been an engrossing, idea-fuelled sci-fi thriller is, in the hands of ho-hum director Tarsem Singh a strictly pedestrian affair."
1," I have no idea how it'll play for people unfamiliar with Smith's work, but I rolled with it."
0," Coupled with Frank's borderline sociopathic 'survival of the fittest' philosophy and his son Rhys Wakefield's bland sulkiness, there's not one likeable character to care about when things go wrong."
0," Yes, it's a relief to see Depp playing a real character again, not another one of his circus freaks -- I just wish he'd been given a better film to operate in."
1, This is summer action done right.
0," ... has its cute moments, but it's the cuteness of desperation ... "
0," By not really improving upon the original, it seems more interested in trying to recapture old magic than in creating something new."
0," Violet and her circle are a row of billboards. By the time the movie peters out, we've already graduated."
0," The Legacy of a Whitetail Deer Hunter could have been really funny, provocative, or something in between. The cast was decent. The premise was sound. And yet, it's only slightly better than an unfruitful hunting trip. "
1," 'Burning Bush' is a rare accomplishment [...] and true to its HBO roots, it works as a fleet-of-foot juicy plot-delivery system."
1," Jessica Rothe handles all of these transitions well, the horror, the action heroey stuff, they sentimental stuff, she's great."
1," You can understand why (Petra Von Kant) is viewed by many as one of Fassbinder's masterpieces. Not bad for ten days' work, anyway."
1," Few scripts toss more challenging balls in the air, and Jonze juggles them all with artful, light-stepping ease. It's magic."
1, A neat and perfumed time bomb. [Full Review in Spanish]
1," Valerian is a film to wallow in, not follow, and if you're tuned to its extra-terrestrial wavelength, you wouldn't cut a second."
0," Ludicrous and atrocious in nearly every way, Lucy is absolutely brainless; which is quite ironic given the concept of the film."
1," Sure it's a bit dated, but that's not the movie's fault. One of Wilder's best films ... and that's saying a whole lot!"
0," There's a lot less going on in The Intern - the story of an old guy who goes to work for one of those fancy new e-commerce places, whatever that is - than meets the eye, or the funny bone. "
1, John Dahl creates an intelligent and character-driven crime-drama built around solid performances by Damon and Norton.
1," It's more of an art movie than a thriller, but it's still gripping, persuasive, unsettling stuff."
0, There is a whole lotta movie in American Honey. But not a movie as a whole.
0," Rick Rosenthal, who directed this 1981 sequel, doesn't have Carpenter's expansive, affectionate way with stereotypical characters, and without it they're empty shells -- bodies waiting for the slaughter."
0, Gladiator certainly feels like it was written by committee and template.
0, Nobody buys a ticket to see a Step Up movie expecting to hear Harold Pinter-esque dialogue or to decipher elaborate plots. That's why they're titled 'Step Up' instead of 'Speak Up' or 'Think Deeply.'
0," John Steinbeck's follow-up to The Grapes of Wrath was destined to seem dwarfed by comparison, in this tale of a Norwegian town occupied by Germans."
1," Kyle killed two men, as a civilian, with his massive Colt .44 Magnum. That's a 'Dirty Harry' gun. Who directed 'American Sniper'? Dirty Harry did. That's terribly ironic."
0," Irritatingly cozy and with few unexpected turns, the film is just too cute for its own good."
0," What the movie is though is boring, senseless, choppy and undeveloped. This is a biggest letdown of 2017. A waste of a top name talent."
0," The obvious care and effort that have gone into Hoffmann, the sometimes memorably contrived passages of virtuosity in the first half, make one reluctant to insist on the collapse of the work as a whole."
1," Javier Bardem's Chigurh is the embodiment of Sheriff Bell's exasperation -- a mythological, Grim Reaper-like figure whose existence makes order and civility implausible."
0, Cook and Alba generate about as much chemistry as a mongoose paired with a rattlesnake.
1," The subheading for The Great Buster is ""A Celebration,"" and that's precisely what Bogdanovich provides."
1, It's a shame director Darnell Martin depends so heavily on the clichï¿½ï¿½d conventions of every other rags-to-riches bio
1," Even if I don't always understand them, these people fascinated, appalled and finally moved me, and Anderson has created a richly layered, believable world for them to struggle within. "
1, The moments when Contemporary Colour diverts from the onstage performances and moves to abstraction are the brightest.
1," It's amiable goofiness, delivered at an emphatic, feverish pitch."
0," Gorgeously shot and flawlessly acted, Jarhead readies the audience for a dramatic wallop it never delivers."
1," If you like your horror mixed with laughs, this anthology threequel is a blast."
0, Gratuitous violence and gore in chaotic martial arts movie. 
1, [Macdonald is] very simply a force of nature.
1," ...an entertaining documentary that also gives the non-geek an education on what a comic book superhero fan really is, which is kind of scary."
0," [S]till better than ""Identity Thief"" "
0," Characters -- Vampire and Lycan alike -- pose, strut and try to look menacing, but they're as scary as a congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses."
1, A movie to saviour again and again on the biggest screen you can get to.
1," Electrifying, enthralling and utterly essential, here's a drama that engages both head and heart with the best David versus Goliath story since Erin Brockovich."
0, Allen has here an interesting idea-that placebos may 'work better' than medicine-to noodle over and ultimately reject; it's just a shame he doesn't entertain us more in the process. [Blu-ray]
1," Mostly Reynolds is really funny, joyfully debasing himself and putting everything he has into making this the giddiest, most enjoyable Deadpool movie imaginable."
1," Watching Sally Field is one of the pleasures of going to the movies. 'Doris' doesn't always give her the material she deserves. But even when the film fails her, Field never fails to shine. "
1," Raw, moving and somewhat akin to having a piano dropped on your head, Precious is a fable of abuse and redemption."
0," It's ludicrous, but not as ludicrous as the ending -- an exhausting game of Twister that'll leave you feeling stupid or cheated or both."
1," There's a ton of good stuff in ""Focus,"" but it's frequently undercut by twist after twist after twist, which sort of make us question why we're supposed to care in the first place."
1," For all the money spent, the film's success is best measured by its simplicity and the purity of its innovation. Jonze has filmed a fantasy as if it were absolutely real, allowing us to see the world as Max sees it, full of beauty and terror."
0, Perry and Campbell's natural rapport is put at the service of an idiot plot.
1," Thor: The Dark World is visually enticing, but in a more ominous way than in the first film. With extraordinary special effects, Thor: The Dark World is sure to be well-liked by those who loved the first film yet isn't nearly as well done."
0," This is a film without a shred of artistic distinction. It lacks even simple craftsmanship. There is no possible motive for exhibiting it, other than the totally cynical hope that it might make money."
1," Arguably the best film of the summer, perhaps even the year."
0, [The] only element of the entire production that inspires any kind of wonder is just how far from a satisfying adaptation the film proves to be.
0, A little more fury might have been a whole lot better.
1, It's like an unexpectedly dry martini in a dazzling Z-stem glass.
1," Layton roots the story in a mixture of peer pressure, toxic masculinity, and the dread of young men who feel the fruits of capitalism growing beyond their reach."
1," In a packed auditorium in 3D, the film is a true thrill ride -- a communal experience of shared screams and relieved laughter."
0, Director Kevin Lima tries relentlessly to create a manic feel that never quite comes off.
0, About as thrilling as a power failure in Antarctica.
1," It is a hoot to watch, even if, to be honest, there's little reason for it to exist."
1," Vampire Cleanup Department's special effects (by Fong Wai-kit) are suitably cheesy, and supporting turns by favorites Siu Yam-yam, comedian Jim Chim and Eric Tsang lend the whole affair some old-school credibility."
0," What is amazing is how the movie manages to be funny and amusing while tippy-toeing around (a) sex, (b) controversy and (c) any originality in the plot."
1," [Washington] fires on all cylinders, running through a range that marks his most accomplished performance in some time, one certainly rating higher than the two that brought him Oscars in the past."
1, Absorbing but slow-moving family drama taking place in post-Soviet Russia.
0, Carpenter should stick to what he's good at-scaring folks-and leave the political satire to Spitting Image.
1," The 52-year-old Cruise doesn't look ridiculous at any point, which in itself is ridiculous."
1, This sequel to 2006's Nanny McPhee is almost as charming as the first.
0," It's difficult to feel positive about Romain's acceptance of his mortality, because Ozon hasn't convinced us Romain was that alive to begin with."
0," As a major filmmaker, it's about time Scorsese found some material that stretched his ideas, rather than his audience's patience."
0," The ending, with its soaring crescendo score and supposed emotional pay-off, is clearly meant to provoke cathartic waterworks. The best my theatre could manage was a polite cough and a guffaw."
1," It won't work for everyone, but it will work for some people. I was one of those people. You might not be. What else can I tell you?"
0, Just another game night.
0," The action is spectacular, but the thinly characterised humans who pilot the robots in mind-synched pairs inevitably get dwarfed. And without vivid heroes to root for, after a while the humungous robot-monster smackdowns lose their impact,"
0," This joyless thriller runs the gamut from unconscionable through unwatchable to unendurable. It's also unfathomable that two talented people, Diane Lane and her director, Gregory Hoblit, got themselves involved in such an unpromising enterprise."
0, Ugh. I need a shower -- I want to be hosed down. This is not the feeling you generally want to be left with after seeing a children's movie.
0, It's a total shame that this time around the celebrated fearmonger was more concerned with bodily functions and corny jokes than with generating any worthy scares.
0, High-concept elements can't obscure how tired the surrogate family storyline is.
1, Easily the best action film not directed by Christopher Nolan to come around in quite some time...
0," ""Sanctum"" should be an intensely claustrophobic adventure movie; it's not."
1," Efficient if not electric, ""The Hunger Games"" is still epic in intent."
1, Scream cleverly plays with movie conventions and the audience's expectations so that we're kept constantly guessing.
1, This is one of my favorite movies of the year so far.
1," The film is constantly laugh-out-loud funny, and the voice cast (which also includes Julie Andrews as Gru's disapproving mother) is exemplary."
0, There's a fundamental problem: a complete lack of humor. It's a comedy with no laughs.
1," Roman J. Israel, Esq. is two great movies combined into a good one. It's anchored by big ideas and a wonderful performance, but stories A and B never mesh into something deeper."
0," I have rarely seen a movie with less self-knowledge than License to Wed, an awful comedy made ever so slightly fascinating because of its dual personality."
1, Part of the joy of Lanthimos's film is seeing in it any degree of subtext you like.
1," Once Cassius starts using his very Caucasian vocals, he becomes the office wunderkind."
1, The Talented Mr. Ripley is worth more than a peep.
1," As clichï¿½ï¿½ as it sounds, despite its few missteps, Sierra Burgess Is A Loser is a winner for Purser, Beer, and Samuels and by extension, Netf"
1," Simply a solid and serviceable biopic, but not really anything special."
1, Visual references and animated marvels abound.
1," As a feat of sheer endurance and courage, The Fellowship of the Ring is astonishing. As an achievement in filmmaking it's triumphant."
1," As a genius work of art, as an experience that will leave some cold and others clamoring for the right level of praise, Never Let Me Go surpasses expectation."
1," The Program is a drama, not a documentary, which allows it to flesh out the bones of this story into something approaching a minor Shakespearean tragedy."
0, Inert musical set to the bubblegum music of the popular 1967 Beatles album.
0," maintains enough interest, although it never quite attains the gripping level of intensity to which it clearly aspires"
0," The Dark Horse takes us intriguingly deep into subcultures we might not otherwise know. Unfortunately, it uses storytelling devices so overly familiar and so flatly executed, they blunt what we see."
0," A dumb, blandly sloganeering love letter to blind faith and willful denial."
1, The film is an ode to our heroine's electric body. [Full review in Spanish]
0," Is there something innately vexing about a story whose premise opens the door so wide, to so many geographical possibilities? Jumper, the film, goes everywhere and nowhere."
1, The Ides of March is a political junkie's dream come true. 
1," A colourful, delightfully raucous cacophony of riotous belly laughs and epic set-pieces, cementing itself as one of most outrageous entries in the series so far. "
1," An intense, schematic, superbly made Vietnam War drama."
0," The psychological vagaries of real people who commit terrible crimes and real people who investigate them are not in the cards here, not when the unaccountable supernatural can be hauled in..."
0," Director Justin Chadwick... seems to have suddenly woken up behind the camera, with no idea of how he got there or what kind of film this is."
1," ""Are we truly the crocodiles who look back into the abyss of time?"" asks Herzog. Good question. And after thinking about the answer for a while, I'm gonna have to go with my gut instinct. ""Eh?"" "
0, ...a spectacularly dull film.
1," The standout moment is when Logan gets to grips with an assailant atop a hurtling bullet train. Fights on the roofs of speeding trains are a cinematic clichï¿½ï¿½, but the giddying velocity of the Japanese train gives the scene a uniquely thrilling momen"
1," Strong familiarity does not breed contempt, and that's all due to two pairs of words: Ashley Judd, Hugh Jackman."
0, Its sins are somewhat mitigated by handsome production design and winning chemistry between Cranston and Hart. But there's nothing particularly memorable about the film.
1, [It does] that one thing that a romance absolutely has to do -- touch us.
1," It might be too soon to watch a movie about the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Nonetheless, a fitting tribute to the passengers of United 93 is long overdue."
0," An almost perfect atrocity. It is a towering K2 of bobbins... the most mangy, noxious, charmless, sexist, racist, unfunny, infantile, stomach-turning, grotesque, clueless, inept and stupid film of the year."
1," Starts as a satire and ends as thriller, making the journey from the one to the other not just a logical progression, but an almost inevitable one."
0," It tries very hard to be fanciful, lyrical, sentimental, magical, rapturous, romantic, heartwarming, tear-jerking and inspiring. The result, however, is a goulash of half-baked bathos."
1," The splendidly mixed and visually overstimulating movie might make your head explode on the spot, Scanners style."
1," The film is classic Gilliam, the imaginative brilliance tempered by moments of incoherence and a strange lassitude."
1, It's a campy mix of wealth porn and affirmative consent fantasy. 
1," Depicting a courageous fight back with compassion and sincerity, this capably played drama has its heart firmly in the right place."
0," The film does mix up the formula in some ways. Unfortunately, these changes are by and large for the worse."
1," Re1ingly well-balanced, Illuminating, provocative, vital and engaging. You'll never look at Zionism the same way again."
0," As in the Bronson series, the new Death Wish is devoid of nuance, feigning ""debate"" (via talk radio sound bites) while depicting everything in figurative, and often literal, black and white terms."
1," That's all you can ask from a survival film such as this: honesty. It's not therefore about life or death, but humanity's perseverance."
0, Some laughs while you are watching but that old deja vu feeling just won't go away.
1, Speed Sisters is as much about sexism in a Palestinian institution that arguably hasn't existed long enough to develop institutionalized sexism as it is about life under the occupation. 
0," Unlike the mansion it's set in, it's a small, hammered-together thing, and it can't bear all this meaning and metaphor."
1," Like other films of the 1970s, Pollack's saga combines nostalgia and cynicism in equal measure, thus pleasing both right-wing and left-wing viewers, not to speak the delight of seeing Robert Redford at his most handsome in a cowboy attire."
1, The harrowing story of three lesbian couples and their adoption fights in Alabama shows just how far we've come as a country in terms of equal rights and how far we have to go state by state to really get there.
1," More understated than sidesplitting, this biting satire of showbiz offers an amusing enough inside peek at what life might be like in Tinseltown to remain recommended, its mostly inside industry jokes notwithstanding."
1," 'Fantasy' often conjures visions of a Tolkien-esque mix of dragons, elves, quests and big blokes with axes, but Japanese writer-director Mari Okada's animated epic has done something impressively new with the genre."
1," Soulfully scored and every bit as powerful in moments of discomforting silence, it's haunting indeed."
1," Rather than simply ignoring physics, it downright defies physics with what we see happen on screen. The result is a giant Looney Tunes car chase for more than two hours."
0, This mincing bad time is built entirely around shrill pop-culture references.
0," On a scale from Gerard Butler to 10, how bad is Hunter Killer?"
1," Insidious has no higher ambition than to scare the audience, and it succeeds much of the time."
1," a hit-and-miss brand of humor, as likely to leave you squirming from embarrassment as howling with laughter."
1, The originality of the documentary format coupled with the splendid CGI effects qualifies Surf's Up as not just another penguin movie.
1," Superior to Episode I -- The Phantom Menace, with its annoying Jar Jar Binks and its dull, galaxy-hopping story line. "
0," At every predictable turn, Table 19 and its superstar cast feels like an arranged marriage of convenience. "
1," I mean, come on -- what was the last kids film that stumbled because it was overreaching in its exploration of inclusiveness? Also -- those sloths!"
0," If only Nim's hero were more original, and its story more concise."
0, Even the considerable imagination and investment on display here can't make this fairytale character - or Kristen Stewart - a viable movie star.
0, Is director Heitor Dhalia's non-thrilling new thriller a condemnation of police ineptitude or his own?
0," The anti-Matrix, celebrating obeisance to random yet tethering nostalgia within a river of brands and platforms and delusions from the 1980s, critiquing lightly but eventually embracing the machine: any machine."
0, So much effort; so little entertainment.
0, A scattershot affair that bobbles along episodically but doesn't quite gel.
0," Arriaga's film beats his audience over the head with the pain of its characters but provides no release, no lessons, and no relatable humanity. It's film for masochists only."
1, Turns out a Tyler Perry movie minus Tyler Perry is a good thing.
1, A thought experiment writ large.
0," If ever there were a film that shoulda-coulda-woulda been great, it's Hands of Stone, an ambitious but disappointing biopic about Panamanian fighter Roberto Durï¿½ï"
0," For what it's worth, ""The Legend of Tarzan"" is several unpretentious cuts above the pompous, leaden ""Greystoke"" of over thirty years ago."
0," In all honesty, there's only so much paranoia and tireless altercation any one person can realistically take."
0," The leads have moments of charm, but a movie deserves stars who sizzle."
1," [A] black comedy loaded with some fabulous, all-American visual touches."
1," Preceded by a 1957 Pluto short, Never Land is a warmly nostalgic throwback."
0," An affluent African-American family is going through some domestic issues: Husband loses job, daughter is being ignored, mother has a foot-odour situation - the usual. The answer? Submit to a resurrected carpenter."
0, Rent the original.
1," [Easily] one of the better films of 2004, but a good deal of this is oddly unmemorable for a Scorsese film."
0, Penn's main idea about going native is making eye contact with a deer.
1," Ameena Matthews, Cobe Williams and Eddie Bocanegra used to instigate Chicago street violence. Now they live for nipping it in the bud, block by treacherous block."
0," What's the problem with government health systems? Moore's movie doesn't ask that question, although it does unintentionally provide several answers."
0," ...a loving and in fact overly adulatory genre film which is not so much a take on the revenge Western as a deeply faithful recreation of it, at times so faithful as to veer dangerously close to pastiche."
1," [An] austere but never ponderous film about war, and its effect on those caught up in impossible circumstances ..."
0, A ponderous and misshapen true-crime tale from France
0, Frank mostly overdoses on portentousness as he roots his solid hero in a city that fears coming to pieces.
1," In this stylish documentary, Cattelan talks effusively on camera about his career, his work, and his private life in unexpectedly candid interviews."
0, The film's skillfulness renders its eventual slide into the routine all the more irritating.
0," Are there any ideas here? Other than to make more than $1.5bn, what is the point of a Michael Bay movie?"
1," Observe and Report is...not afraid to take chances, to push envelopes, and explore elements that usually don't make it into a satire or spoof."
0," An interesting story, uninterestingly told: Trapero's take on an unusual tale of Argentine criminality won't win any new converts to his country's national cinema. "
1," Beauty and the Beast creates an air of enchantment from its first moments, one that lingers and builds and takes on qualities of warmth and generosity as it goes along."
0," Zoe Saldana's woeful casting is just one of a myriad of reasons to despise Nina, as its plot and characterization fail to glean any insight into the iconic musician and Civil Rights activist."
0, The supporting cast takes some of the comic weight off the always likeable Vaughn's shoulders. But Wilkinson's character is too sad-sack to be really funny and Franco's verges on the mawkish.
1," along with the fun, and there's plenty of that, there's a level of sophistication not seen before in this film franchise, a willingness to ponder the big questions"
0, I'm sending it back.
1," The filmmaking is expert. Watch how Lelio uses mirrors and windows, especially in the moments just after the aforementioned family attack. "
1, Don't go expecting a masterpiece but with this reverential nod to its heritage and a bloody amazing visual treat - you'll have a rollocking good time.
0, It's self-referential and self-rewarding to the point that it has virtually no other content.
1," Even the most stalwart viewers, prior fans or not, will be squirming in their seats."
0," Bad science-fiction has a new name, and it is Battlefield Earth, the early frontrunner for this year's worst movie."
1, It seems the poisoned apple doesn't fall far from the rotting tree. 
0, Youth is a hodgepodge of music and dissonance.
1," Stunningly moving and powerful: intimate, passionate, often shocking, and almost mesmerically absorbing."
1," The solid performances, stunning cinematography and visuals, and revamped and brutal Freddy make this A Nightmare on Elm Street worth checking out"
1," Here is a man who experienced something terrible and strange, and who has been using his art as a method of exploring his psyche. That's very human."
1," This is about two people who didn't know what their lives were until they met each other, then scrambling, in their muted, buttoned-up way, to figure out what happens next. Haynes loves them so much that he believes they can. You will too."
0," Like the original, it's ultra loud and often looks like a PlayStation game. But when the fast and furious bludgeoning and blow-ups wane, the screen may as well be tuned to channel zero."
0," A shrill, embarrassing comedy that insults the female audience for which it is intended. "
0," Bay is so afraid of boring his audience, he pitches every scene at the same high volume right from the first shot, and the effect is exhausting."
1, An absolute delight.
1," While nothing here matches the original, it's a gentle, affirming destination for those in search of a pleasant, G-rated outing."
1, It's hard to imagine a scenario where James White can't be pointed to as among the best of this year's American debuts. 
0," Well, at least it's not another origin story. "
1," Bale is good--solid amid the ongoing storm--but don't expect much of him. This is Sam Worthington's movie, and he steals it."
0," Rips off Doc Hollywood, almost note for note."
0, This has to go down as the most disappointing film of the year.
1," Malick, who is obviously unconcerned with his film's commercial success, continues to work with cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, and together they have grown immensely fond of long, lovely shots of nature."
0," Like so many modern animated features, Free Birds packs too much in; the picture feels cramped and cluttered, and, despite its occasionally manic action, it moves as slowly as a fattened bird waddling toward its doom."
0," ""Pulse"" is the kind of horror movie that genre fans should see at least once. Allow yourself plenty of time and patience. You'll need it. "
0," Greene's strategy is to be ironically inept: His nonfiction wanderings with Sheil feel halfhearted, but the attempts at scenes dramatizing Chubbuck are intentionally awful, staged like amateur soap opera and written in cheap clichï¿½ï"
1, ... turns some sobering and timely questions about press power and presidential abuses into eminently satisfying screen entertainment.
1," The best comedy of the summer, animated or not, and perceptive parents may enjoy it even more than their offspring."
1, A movie that can be a bit hard to relate to at first but eventually lures you in with its strong writing and performances.
0," Tries to be a Christmas film about real ishoos but it is quite boring and predictable and sentimental and the acting is not very good. It is therefore perfect for Christmas, and upholds all the traditions very, very well."
1," With the help of deft editing and a sometimes frantic electronic score, director John Madden (""Shakespeare in Love"") turns this story of backroom machinations into a moderately entertaining thriller."
1," The smartest thing about ""Horrible Bosses"" is that it both refuses to just clock in and waste time - and, at the same time, works extra hard to hold our attention."
0," A 90 minute cacophony of bullets, bombs, and other things that go boom, delivered without the tiniest thread of excitement."
0," For a film that presents itself as a broadside against prejudice, Towelhead spends an awful lot of time flattering the prejudices of its audience."
1," ""The Help"" definitely worked on me as a consummate tear-jerker with a terrific cast, and it's pretty much the summer's only decent Hollywood drama."
0, A gruelling experience that heads off the rails and feels more like personal therapy for director Darren Aronofsky rather than a film for public consumption.
1," Young children will adore this sweet white mouse, although older kids and impish adults may miss the edginess of ""Lilo & Stitch."""
0," Although this infamous crime caper has a terrific cast, it's uneven and forgettable,"
0," Not sure what we're supposed to expect from a dark, girl-power, Disney-brand sort-of sequel to The Nutcracker, [but] 'Helen Mirren fighting hussar Terminators with a bullwhip' isn't a key third act element that leaps immediately to mind."
0, It takes Sydney Pollack 135 minutes to get to the end of an affair that would've taken certain French directors an hour and half to show.
1, Entourage is the male fantasy of anyone who's ever dreamed of conquering Hollywood. [Full review in Spanish]
0," The Mechanic is well acted and provides plenty of gunfights and explosions but the action sequences are underwhelming, the plot lacks focus and the overall effect is disappointing."
0," The dragon is battled by dwarf, elf and Hobbit in a semi-decipherable battle of industrial de-evolution. Gold seethes down like the sweetest Caramelo candy bars passed down from the Gods. Oh, the beauty of the fallen, fiscal world. "
0," Ambitious, grandiose, occasionally compelling but far more often irritating and laughable."
1," Likeable despite its silliness, Evolution delivers a solid entertainment package."
0," After a while, the film feels more like a cute conceit that hasn't really been developed further. It's intriguing, and very well-acted, but empty."
1, ...rescues the Godzilla genre from the realm of kitsch.
0, At the risk of being lynched by hardcore horror freaks ... the Dawn of the Dead remake was more effective. So was 28 Days Later. And Resident Evil.
0," With lame action, dull storytelling and a cast that look like they simply don't care, it's sub-par style over non-existent substance as The White Haired Witch of Lunar Kingdom laboriously plods through its 104 minute running-time."
1," still indicative of a genre in its infancy, nowhere near as steadfastly classic as the cream of the cell-animated crop. Brilliant stuff, but not outstanding."
1, The Heart Machine frustrated me in the best possible way.
0," While Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon are fun and draw some solid laughs from the limitations of the premise, this particular trip is still baggy and self-indulgent."
0," The film flirts with the substance of a delicious main course, but ends up being an annoying succession of hors d'oeuvres that never fill you up."
1," Beautiful and darkly festive. Dan Stevens' Dickens is prone to bah humbug, with six weeks to write a Christmas classic. Victorian London is bustling and clean; Plummer's Scrooge dour and mocking; gratifyingly, ordinary people are assumed to be well-read."
1," [It's] such a solid, confident debut that you have to wonder why it took [MacFarlane] so long to make the jump in the first place."
0," The conceit is riveting at first because Knight forgoes any backstory or exposition, though as the foreman's plight becomes clear, the tension quickly dissipates."
1," Sembene! should be a major step in drawing attention back to a titan of world cinema, whose influence was never contained by the frame, or the screen."

0, Perhaps it's time for all of us to recognize that fantasies come in a great many more than 50 shades - and that they're not real.
1," Four neighboring families, seven stories, one secret - one great movie."
1," The best-looking Star Wars episode of all, if not the most exciting, most imaginative or most affecting."
1," [Anderson] makes us laugh, he makes us think, and he does it in a distinctive screwball style."
1, The detective ducks into a movie theater and finds himself watching a (heroic) film version of himself. His response - a snicker tinged with melancholy and disdain - speaks volumes about the futility of trying to dictate how we will be remembered.
1," For all of its flaws, it completely captures the sense of amity that keeps the real Stan and Ollie's work so enduring to this day."
0, Magic in the Moonlight has the tiredness of hearing someone tell the same joke consecutive times.
0, What does Coppola want us to think about these beautiful young idiots? What does she think? She's too cool or too wary or too close to her subject to engage.
0," One of those ""prestige"" pictures that you can watch with your dear old Mom ... provided your Mom won't be offended by the unclothed young ladies."
1," Verhoeven's cinematic wet dream delivers the goods, especially when Sharon Stone struts on with enough come-on carnality to singe the screen."
0, You could make a better feature by repeatedly throwing a camera into a lake. 
1, A portrait of the artist as a hermit wife that overcomes some clunky early brushstrokes to achieve a genuine grace and considerable poignancy.
1, A pleasurably jacked-up piece of action moviemaking.
0," If you're looking for a primer on the worst ways to adapt an Elmore Leonard novel, look no further."
0, Too much synthetic spotlessness to score a real and grimy touchdown of credibility and inspiration.

1," A comedy adventure that the whole family can enjoy, right down to the age of five."
1," When the head-to-head heavy hitting finally transpires -- be patient, for it takes some time to get there -- Dawn of Justice delivers the shock and awe on a level befitting a superhero blockbuster of such massive scale."
1," My whole life I've been a horror-movie freak, and I've rarely been as scared as I was at It Follows. But it wasn't a fun kind of scare. It was the so-upset-I-feel-sick kind of amorphous dread."
1," It is a bold and often beautiful movie, unfashionably and unironically concerned with love and God, and what will happen to us in the absence of either."
1," Despite a somewhat slow start and occasional plot missteps, Iron Man 3 ultimately soars thanks to its charismatic leading man and director Shane Black's man-on-wire balancing act of humor and action."
0," Each story on its own could have been expanded and worked into a compelling single feature, but in its current incarnation, Storytelling never quite gets over its rather lopsided conception."
0," This is the kind of picture that may often make you snort audibly, even as you're wondering how the heck it's going to resolve itself."
1," As in the Grimm Brothers stories, there's something very pagan in Coraline, something that doesn't jibe with our feelings that good always defeats evil. Rather it insists that cleverness and a little treachery is always needed to save our skins."
0," With stock MMA fight shots taken, there are a total of three fights shown in the film. The sound is so unsynchronised, that you hear punches which Jeetu didn't even throw. The performances are more comical than serious, and not in a good way."
1," For those of you who can handle the cerebral drama that marks some of the best sci-fi, The Quiet Earth is for you."
0," It's extreme for its own sake, and too rarely for the satirical purposes of Baron Cohen's better vehicles, ""Borat"" and ""Bruno."""
1," It's a patient film, and it requires some patience from its audience. But its rewards are gentle and winning, and for once, a cinematic history lesson that doesn't feel artificial and processed in every pore."
0, Merde that meets the eye.
0," The film still doesn't quite know how to capture or contain that energy, so it all just sort of goes splat on-screen. It's haphazard, and it somehow just barely works. "
0," Stiller, Vaughn and Hill --- all three of them phoned in their performances. "
0," ""Girl Asleep"" thinks it's a stylishly resonant fairy tale about identity when the primary takeaway is an exquisitely curated slide show."

1," An intellectually stimulating and provocative film that raises more questions than it answers. In our age of increasingly rapid technological advances, this examination of the notion of progress is timely. It is, indeed, a vital necessity."
1," Everyone LOVED the first one. Then they ""kinda tolerated"" the second one. Logic dictates that the third one ""sucks"". I disagree."
1, A genuinely hilarious comedy with a brilliantly funny script and terrific comic performances.
0, The fault lies not with the new cast; it's the lackluster script and the mediocre movie that they're saddled with.
0, A bad sequel to a mediocre previous installment. Who could've predicted this?
0," Overlong, overdone and overwrought, the narratively challenged Set It Off gets off on exploitation shock and social-conscience schlock in equal measure."
0," It almost goes without saying that the film looks gorgeous, but the filmmaking behind it feels unsure how to work on this grand a scale. Australia is big. But it never fills the screen."
1," A genre-blurring gem that combines elements of sci-fi creature feature, road movie and indie romance ... District 9 meets It Happened One Night, with a dash of Mumblecore."
1," Certainly, The Grandmaster is far from Wong's best. But it's a beautiful creation all the same."
1," ... doesn't soar to the emotional heights to which it aspires, but it provides some white-knuckle tension for those unfamiliar with the outcome, especially in the second half."
0," Bleak, brutal, pretentious, over-agitated and only somwhat suspenseful."

1, A lovely low-key comedy with a rock 'n' roll heart.
0, A garbled account of state-aided terror that sheds little light on these dogs of war.
0," Rogue One: A Star Wars Story has gorgeous visuals, including an excellent production design and great special effects, but when it comes to the narrative, there's a lot left to be desired thanks to a screenplay that refuses to develop the characters."
1," The effort is well worth it. ""Happy Death Day 2U"" is a blast."
0," This is one of those films where the humor is of the hit-and-miss variety, and it misses more often than it hits. The jokes are transparent. It's not difficult to divine what's supposed to be funny."
0, Another movie is turned into a turkey.
1," The film shocks with its sheer stateliness, its almost quiet abstraction of tumultuousï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ melo"
1," The best marriage of intense, exciting, bloody action with a strong, affecting story I have ever seen."
0, Gemini is a who cares whodunit. It is a mystery thriller without any mystery or thrills.
1," This is a movie for kids, for adults, and for those still deciding which one of those they are. And it has the best Star Wars joke you'll ever see."
0," At just 75 minutes, even a car on blood still runs out of gas."
1," ...and there's that perennial ""winning isn't everything"" theme that runs throughout the picture, which is kind of hypocritical."
1, If the folks who made Hollywood were going to make a movie today it would be made like The Aviator.
0," It's a Nicolas Cage movie, so, admit it, you're expecting crazy. You have no idea."
0, Haider starts off promisingly. It's too bad that the promise never delivers.
1, Edgerton has a lot to say with Boy Erased; it's a virtuous film. But Hedges is the movie's heartbeat.
0, For me Ctrl is a case of too much talking (about stuff I'm not versed enough in to fully grasp) and not enough forward momentum. A low-fi intellectual take on the sentient machine.
1, A psychosexually intriguing blend of Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window and William Friedkin's Cruising ...

1," This is a fun, cool, wild ride. "
0, ...not even amusing enough to at least stimulate our negative response beyond dozing off.
0," Terminator Salvation is a tale told idiotically, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing."
1," Dolan's latest movie feels like a horror movie zapped into our universe from some other, more compassionate dimension."
1," The most remarkable thing about Love, Simon is how comfortable it feels with just being what it is: an ordinary teen romantic comedy. And yet, it feels so very special. [Full Review in Spanish]"
0," If you took ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,"" ""Pee-Wee's Big Adventure"" and a gallon of super-sweet cake frosting and put them in a giant industrial blender set to ""suck,"" this is exactly the kind of bile-inducing bon-bon that might result."
0, Predictable plotting weighs down an intriguing premise.
0," It's not clear whether the director, Brad Silberling, is camping it up or simply trying to get through it all without too much strain."
0, Our obsession with style over substance is becoming pathological. When are we going to get sick of this stuff?
1," What makes the movie compelling, despite the subdued dramatic payoff, is that it is a heightened reflection of our experience - our love affair, really - with our gadgets, our apps and, yes, our brands."
1, The music and dance that are such hallmarks of Bollywood filmmaking are here seamlessly incorporated into the story rather than creating a pause in the action.
1," The Beaver makes for a creative portrayal of mental illness, and of family life around those who live in the dark, reaching a fine balance of drama and comedy."
0," The advances up for grabs date the script instantly to a jollier time for publishing, but it's more of a bummer that Lesley Manning's direction is of the plonk-the-camera-anywhere variety."
0," Hide and Seek arrives with a promotion worthy of William Castle: a final reel SO SHOCKING, it's delivered separately to theaters via ARMED GUARDS! That's the good news. The bad news: The other reels arrive as well."
1," This is not entirely your average greasy teen movie, and frequently manages to be quite funny, and ambivalent, about vicious competitiveness at US high schools and sickly, sex-saturated modern life."

0," It might work for little kids, but that doesn't justify the lackluster and humorless script. [Full review in Spanish]"
1," The intimate, home video footage -- which has never been shown -- feels poignant, a throwback to Basquiat's early days on the New York scene when he got by on his good looks, an elusive inner confidence, and the generosity of others."
0," It's hard to think of any recent film that features more ridiculous, cornball dialogue."
1," The Kid Who Would Be King is fun, inspiring in its messaging and idealism, and optimistic in young people's abilities to right the wrongs handed down to them."
0," Kasdan's script mines familiar ground without finding gems. That's too bad, because it's blessed with honest, unflinching performances from three leads."
0," Revenge boasts Martin Scorsese as an executive producer (and it really does boast - Scorsese's is the first name we see), but the clichï¿½ï¿½-ridden narrative and patchy acting prevent the film from being Chinatown's answer to Goodfel"
1," Rian Johnson's film is the real deal, a bold, risky venture unafraid to tell its own story, freed from the weight of nostalgia and formula."

1, The mesmerizing espionage thriller chronicles the inception and ascendancy of the CIA.
1," Despite its shortcomings, there are things about this film that are hard to shake; the movie's ultimate wisdom and overarching compassion make it very likely that you won't want to shake them, after all."
0, You understand this metaphor already -- life is like a house that changes as you grow -- and then Life smashes us over the head with it for two hours.
0," If Burton had ever worried that his celebrated brand of eccentricity might one day feel dated or even irrelevant, that unthinkable day may indeed have come."
1," Where Jackson might occasionally misstep tonally, he takes the reigns from the episodic original and runs with generally fantastic results through several narrative additions, all of which give the characters more agency in their own affairs."
0, The movie contains some of the same elements that made [Dogtooth] so startling but they tend to float around rather than coalesce into a singular perspective.
0," By the end, there's precious little humanity left amid all the nuts and bolts."
1," The performances without exception are top-notch, and in truth, better than the film probably deserves."
0," Transformers: The Last Knight is a punishing, pummeling experience."
1," By its ambiguous yet hopeful end, we're at one with Nick and Meg: Sometimes, you just have to dance. Somehow, you go on."
1, The interesting thing about The Purge series is how readily and easily the central premise develops into something with a little more bite. 
1, Mythically beautiful.
1, Sweet Home Alabama is a sweet treat that really tastes good after the bland entrï¿½ï¿½e of September movies that we have been forced to dig
1," By delivering the story within the framework of genre cinema at its most trashy and garish, the filmmakers convey any message as a bit of rough pleasure amid the kicks and thrills of a movie."
1," [The director's] style works well with the script, which is, while perhaps not the most engaging story, interesting and fun enough to sustain the film."
0," In a have, have-not society the script might have had less threat of gore and more depth as a genuine thought-provoking social commentary of our times."
0, Calculated with the precise goal of conjuring a tearful reaction to cute critters.
1," To its credit, the film has far less to do with the specifics of one event and instead focuses on a far more universal message of recovery, self-doubt and the reconciliation and acceptance required to overcome any personal loss."
0," There may have been a very good comedy in this scenario, or even a serious drama, but all we end up in here is no man's -- and no laughs -- land."
0, A one-note slasher satire without a punch line. 
0, Torremolinos 73 goes overboard with the movie within a movie gag.
1," If we're laughing at the movie: there's something very gratifying about the regularity with which Harlin cuts his cheesy characters down to size. And as a piece of cinematic engineering, it's nothing if not efficient."
1," Mainly rollicks along, keeping a nice balance between grotesque-alien playfulness and badass secret-agent seriousness. The story doesn't have as much fun with the near-alien weirdnesses of 1969 as it could have but the ending comes with a poignant twist."
1," Superficially simple, Anomalisa is actually a thoroughly complex web of human experience, recognisably real, even though the characters are 30 cm tall stop motion puppets"
1," It's a puzzle of strange pleasures, a nerve-racking way of recalibrating how to look at the screen and the world outside the screen."
1," Keep the Change may be a breakthrough in its focus on real people with intellectual disabilities, but it's especially commendable for providing positive examples of how the nondisabled can create inclusive environments for all."
1," This first episode works well enough. Underneath the murk, the darkness, the desperation, the blood and the gruesome autopsies, lies a golden heart of goofy fun and satire."
0," AVP will probably satisfy its fans' most basic desires. But, like most sugar rushes, it won't satisfy them for long."

1," Silly, but lots of fun for older teens."
1," The film, too, demonstrates solid funny bones, producer-kingmaker Judd Apatow calling in favours enough to please even the most demanding of pop fans and comedy nerds."
1," The results may leave you aghast or breathless with laughter, but you won't be neutral."
1," Ultimately, T2 is a grown-up sequel made with re1ing maturity."

0," The Sea of Trees uses depression, cancer and suicide as manipulative devices to tug at heartstrings instead of offering insight into the human condition."

0," In his attempt to make the audience sympathize with Hallam, [director] Mackenzie uses the cheapest trick in the book: attempting to give the audience a link into his head with a manic soundtrack."
1," Chazelle's film, with its unfettered embrace of the imperfect, creates nothing less than a vital symphony of the human condition."

1, Melancholy characters shine in this powerful portrait of island life.
0," Filled with dazzling moments, Vengo never quite reaches the heights those moments promise."
0, The key to 'Twilight Zone''s success is that the episodes don't waste time finding rational explanations for the cosmic thing that's happening. This one does.
1," Results is not without nice touches, and will raise a sm ile more than a few times. Guy Pearce's slightly off-kilter performance as philosophy-driven Trevor is worth a look."
0," While this nouveau Fright Night does a reasonable job of maintaining the fun spirit of the original film, ... (it) never quite makes a convincing case for its own existence. "
1," Not that it needed demonstrating, but Hardy once again shows what quiet force and phenomenal range he has. He's like a young Liam Neeson with Michael Fassbender chops."
1," The bottom line is that Toni Erdmann works because of its excess, not in spite of it. Don't wait for the Hollywood version, see the original. "
0," Up-and-comer Joey King is the only bright spot as Aidan's teenage daughter Grace who is fanatically committed to her Orthodox faith, arguably in the absence of strong parental guidance."
1," Depp doesn't exactly give a great performance, but it is an accomplished one that keeps whimsy in balance with dark fears of failure and loss and, yes, having to grow up."
0," The frequent disorientation makes things drag; it's hard to get a sense of the movie's pace when you're unsure how all these miscellaneous pieces fit together, or even whether they do."
0," Exhausted is how many audiences members will feel after squirming through such a repetitive, one-joke comedy."
0, The question of why anyone would bother to make another film version of `Oliver Twist' is not answered by director Roman Polanski.
1," Cruel Intentions is smarter and funnier than anything in the recent cycle of high-school sex comedies... but it's little more than a wildly uneven, sporadically enjoyable guilty pleasure."
1," The best sequence is without doubt the film's first. But the central battle is indeed spectacular, and as 'The Age of Orc' approaches, it rounds out this particular story in stirring and emotional fashion."
1," It's a master class in structure, a meticulously built period piece, a powerful anti-war film, and rarest of all, a thriller whose tension and suspense feel genuinely earned. "
1," As a companion to the documentary, it is the fascinating result of what [Al] Pacino himself seems to consider a creative failure."
1, John Malkovich's eccentric performance elevates this showbiz comedy about a delusional has-been way above its routine text.
1," [A] sharp, wild, self-critical... story. [Full review in Spanish] "
0," While zine-style animated sequences and VHS taped interviews enliven the pace, the documentary is burdened by too much minutiae. Not every scar earned at a concert deserves to be immortalized in a documentary."
1," Kristen Stewart is allowed to make the most of her slightly bored, slightly agitated alto, rattling off a neverending stream of job offers and plans with cucumber cool."
0, So awful as to make heterosexual men actively loathe Playboy.
1," in this cat-and-mouse thriller, while red herrings might be expected, it is the black comedy that is the real surprise, rescuing Headhunters from both Norwegian dourness and Tinseltown blandness."
0," This tepid indie comedy lacks a consistent tone; directors Tom Dolby and Tom Williams can't decide whether to satirize or sympathize with their wealthy, self-regarding characters."
0, The film does not know how to build its characters and is limited to showing misery. [Full review in Spanish]
1," A challenging, heartfelt but often confusing drama that seesaws between the Paris of 1969 and contemporary Montreal."
1, The technical tail never wags the narrative dog. Long may Anderson adhere to his own high ideals.
0," Here's what's missing: tension, drama, and most of all, a sense of wonder. This is a superhero movie, isn't it?"
1," Iannucci made the bravura decision to make a factual film of that event dressed in the black robe of English satire at its darkest. Surely, there was no other intelligent way to bring the story to an audience 75 years after the event. "
0," The biggest shortcoming of ""Blank City"" is that, despite its vivid portrait of the time period, we never get much sense of what the actual movies are like."
0," Frankly it all feels a bit obvious, perfunctory and dated."
0," For people who hated the prequels or just outgrew their love for Salacious Crumb action figures and Star Wars Holiday Special references, it will probably feel like 90 minutes in the Sarlacc pit."
0," The Catcher Was a Spy has every element needed for a gripping espionage thriller, but sadly falls flat with its placid direction."
1, Everlasting Moments is a true masterpiece.
1, The visually arresting animation is more than enough to compensate when narrative confusion threatens to overwhelm.
0, The mundaneness of misery can only be compelling for so long.
0," anyone who goes to 'Instinct' expecting a terrifying thriller will find 'The Serenity of the Gorillas' is a long, long way from 'The Silence of the Lambs.'"
0," Happiness didn't really need a follow-up; it said everything it needed to say and had quite the indelible, ahem, climax. "
1," Strongly written parts -- and good performances, particularly by lead actor and executive producer Anthony LaPaglia -- enliven the film's brush with the familiar."
1, George A. Romero's Land of the Dead reveals that Romero remains the master of a genre he reinvented.
0," While the film goes off in a million different directions, it eventually winds up going nowhere."
1, Miike's magnificent 13 mark both the end of an era and the boundary of a genre.
1," Dissonance between fantasy and reality aside, this poetic essay moves us because we know that its evocation... is very present in that acute pain from which humanity will never recover completely. [Full review in Spanish]"
0, So in love with itself and its own supposed transgressions that it loses sight of the fact that it's become the very thing it's supposed to be taking down.
1, Penn's empathy with his driven hero is unmistakable and deeply felt.
1, Good performances and simple effects lift this generally dry but fascinatingly cerebral Big Concept sci-fi drama. 
1, A dark but enthralling drama that casts a shadow of violence over every scene. 
1, It's hard to get too worked up about a film whose very title announces its maker's intent.
0," Liam Neeson has a particular set of skills, but choosing worthwhile projects is no longer one of them."
0," The movie itself is unfulfilling. It just hangs there, like the aftertaste of stale beer."
1, Um filme povoado por pessoas que tentam encontrar sentido onde nï¿½ï¿½o hï¿½ï¿½
0," Lance Bass, say 'Bye Bye Bye' to your dreams of movie stardom."
1," The film unfolds in a confined space but there is nothing constrained or contained in its searching, intense approach and nothing dogmatic about its approach to its subject."
0," Generally speaking, the film suffers from a somewhat fuzzy storytelling style."
0, What seemed edgy and brash in the original film is now routine and old-hat.
1, There is nothing revolutionary about Creation but it tells an absorbing true story and finds a human perspective to some extraordinary historical events.
1," Faster and, if possible, furiouser than its predecessors."
0, Darwin is not only compromised and needlessly long but politically timid.
0," Mainly, Shyamalan's spookfest suffers from an acute case of monotony. "
1," ...the exceedingly familiar storyline does tend, within the film's meandering midsection, to prevent one from wholeheartedly embracing the material..."
0, The one in which Clint Eastwood gets raped... [Blu-ray]
1," The movie's effectiveness boils down to Ms. Keaton. You cheer for her when she laughs. You sympathize with her when she weeps. And when she does both at the same time, you realize how completely human her character is."
0," Kind of dark for a so-called ""kids"" flick. Outside of being too much of a downer in critical places, there isn't a lot of wonder in Wonder Park. "
0, Drop Dead Gorgeous hasn't enough structural savvy to make it a winner.
1," For all his bankability, Hitch was underappreciated until this study came along. Jones vibes off that idea, turning Truffaut's enthusiasm into an honorable act of reclamation."
0," ""Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse"" will test your optimism."
0," Billy Bob Thornton teaches kids about drinkin', cussin', and a little bit of baseball - not a classic, but still occasionally fun."
0," It's unfortunate that Enter the Void is so fundamentally idiotic, its unholy combination of Tibetan Buddhism and crude melodrama becoming maddeningly repetitive and turgid."
0, ...like a Florida dinner theater production of The Lord of the Rings...
1," Almodovar's latest feels a bit lackluster after his recent string of excellent films, but it still contains some inspired, cinema-on-cinema sequences."
0," The film is visually impressive and I'd be lying if I said I didn't laugh a few times. But too often, the gags aren't so much quirky as just plain jarring."
0, Angry Birds shows that what happily fritters away a few idle moments on your mobile phone doesn't necessarily have the substance for a 95-minute feature.
0, Gratingly vapid and wholly unoriginal.
1, The psychological damage inflicted here is worse than any bite wound.
1, [The film] contrives to wag its own finger at itself -- to have its bonbon and eat it too.
0, We've seen this a hundred times before...only better.
0," Exactly the movie you think it is, but not the movie you want it to be."
1," The Little Death is bold, brave and original."
1," Equal parts sensitive and overwrought, intelligent and preachy."
1," If the results are less satisfying than the previous entries in the trilogy, there's nothing like an [Roy] Andersson film, in which every scene has been painstakingly crafted for maximum visual impact."
0," The film has more moving parts than a pricey Rolex, and they are not all in sync."
0," While I'm generally inclined to applaud an action movie that seeks to be more than just an exercise in carnage, ""The Villainess"" turns wearyingly stop-and-go whenever it tries to fill in the void of its protagonist's emotional and psychological history."
0, Maybe seek out a Noah Baumbach film instead.
1," RocknRolla isn't as jammed with visual pyrotechnics as Ritchie's Lock, Stock and Smoking Barrel (1998), but that's OK, because with anything more happening, the movie could induce motion sickness."
1," The final scenes are both ambiguous and terrifying, and they left a preview audience as shaken as any I've seen."
0, [John Woo] sacrifices logic and narrative coherence with less hesitation than one of his villains would display in shooting an accomplice to avoid apprehension.
0," It's an E-ticket ride. But in the end, there's no heart, no moral to this story. And for all our sweat as viewers, the one thing we crave by Crank's closing credits is detox."
0, Happy Endings has nothing new to say -- and takes way too long not to say it.
0," Solo, like the Falcon in Empire, tends to sputter just when it should leap into hyperdrive."
1," 'One of the guys who killed the dog in John Wick' has delivered a genuinely moving family film, albeit an R-rated one with pedophile jokes, and one of the rare instances where a sequel surpasses the original."
1," A film that manages to be gorgeous, scary, sexy and vicious, all at once."
1, Hitch has us from hello.
1, Director Chris Columbus returns to his comic roots with a teen romp reminiscent of the '80s.
1," The very crudeness of the film stock and technique contribute mightily to the feeling that things are out of control, disoriented and possibly subject to unnatural laws."
0," Gory rather than scary, mean-spirited rather than funny, Jennifer's Body is a nasty piece of work."
0," This version of the Musketeers story can't decide if it wants to be an old-fashioned tale of swashbuckling adventure and palace intrigue or a cheeky, effects-heavy rethink of some iconic characters a la the Guy Ritchie-directed Sherlock Holmes."
1, Intruders is tautly directed by first-time feature filmmaker Adam Schindler.
0," It overstates -- and over-stats -- its case, at times making that case as overly simplistic and over-determined as it argues American masculinity is."
0, The latest installment of the life of Bridget Jones is tired and sloppy.
0," So do you think the war on terror is one big joke? ... Even if you do, this is comedy that, for all its heavy-handed political satire, just isn't funny."
0, Pointlessly repellent.
0, The movie in between the mayhem ... is incomprehensible and wildly overacted by the non-combatants -- especially Karyo.
1," Stylishly directed thriller with some terrific action sequences and mostly strong performances, but the cheese factor is ridiculously high, the characters are thinly drawn and it's morally dubious to say the least."
1," Baffling from beginning to end, but also woozily beautiful."
1," Ang Lee's film is not only a fine and gorgeous Western (in the first act), but an intimate epic love story in the classic Hollywood tradition."
0, A straight-ahead political thriller that fails to ratchet up the requisite tension despite its timely subject matter and (largely) effective cast.
0, Really Ordinary People
0," Robin Hood, an inherently useless look at the origin of the folklore hero, drains the character of all significance."
0," Ultimately, it proves to be a bit long in the tooth, but a few bits manage to do the series proud."
1," Tesla, government black ops, and a shadowy cabal running the world all wrapped up in a nifty neo-noir that pays suitable homage to the genre. Be still my foolish heart."
1, ... Blade II is more enjoyable than the original.
0," It's all just a day at the beach, harmlessly fun and instantly forgettable."
0," The subject of the film is the perversion of youth, and its greatest achievement (if one can call it that) is how it somehow manages to pander to a youth audience while also cinematically chiding them."
1," Nair makes sure there's a real person with real skill and real passion working the levers, imbuing even the corniest moment with real feeling."
0," This is routine Roth as usual. Homophobia, attempted nihilism, vapid writing, paper thin plot, and nonsensical all the way..."
1," Here is Nicholson's classic, post-Mitchum cool, but humanly exposed, providing the star punch in Antonioni's pensive dreamscapes."
1," Whether in trying to reach out for a wider audience here she has diluted her talent in favour of a richer, more stylish surface is a matter for argument. The smoother this kind of film gets, the easier it is to think it."
1," By pumping up the darkly comedic undertones, augmenting the frigid chill of the original, Moland's terrific, riveting picture distinguishes itself from other rote remakes."
1, Viggo Mortensen chews it up and spits it out as the corrupt centerpiece of maverick director David Cronenberg's searing mob thriller.
0, Maybe Schwarzenegger's next movie will be as fascinating as his decision to star in it.
1," No comparison to the book, but not bad for a chuckle. Harmless fun with primate puppets."
1," Despite its little twists and departures from the norm, Gosford Park is basically a crowd-pleaser, a slight film with a fat ensemble all keen to entertain."
0," A mostly contrived and uneven drama that lacks nuances and fails to pack an emotional punch, but at least it's mildly engaging thanks to warm, heartfelt performances and exquisite cinematography."
0, It all feels like piling on - the campaign movie as blooper reel.
1," In today's ironic age, a movie like The House of the Devil that wears its homages proudly%u2014and wears them this well%u2014is something to be celebrated, and this Blu-ray release should attract it the fanbase it deserves."
0, Compared to Roland Emmerich behemoths it's downright minimalist. That's not a compliment.
1, There may not be quite enough here to make a meal and the many postcard-ready views of Cairo reduce the film to a travelogue at times but Nadda knows how to make the quiet moments between her leads speak volumes.
0," The darkness of Oldboy has been diluted, leaving the feature with the curdled consistency of a lesser Stallone vehicle while Lee directs with alarming passivity."
1," 'Your mind is a powerful asset,' Terry tells Kauflin early in the film, and we realize this is a man who creates the 'happiest sound in jazz' even without his trumpet"
0," Despite a worthy cast and a fun premise, this comedy feels like a missed opportunity."
0," Unduly somber, self-important, and clumsily executed, this Omen is best unseen and unheard. You have been warned."
1," With her first feature-length documentary Over the Limit, Polish writer-director Marta Prus does for rhythmic gymnastics what Damien Chazelle did for drumming in Whiplash."
0," Though the cast are willing, the movie plods along in need of the zingy flavours and hot spices we see going into Elizondo's cooking."
0, It's a moderately enjoyable escapade that isn't quite clever enough for adults and not quite imaginative enough for children.
0, A forgettable non-event ... almost as aggravating as David Cronenberg's A Dangerous Method.
0," More disappointing than the lack of inspiration here is the taint of corporate bias... A studio that has billions of dollars' worth of skin in the game of flogging sequels, merchandise and theme parks is in no position to issue moral instruction. "
1," ...Egoyan's ""Memento"" by way of ""This Must Be the Place"" exhibits a strong directorial hand from Christopher Plummer's dissolving determination to inspired art direction."
1, The film is held aloft by the loamy charm of Mark Rylance. 
1," With its crowd-pleasing demonstration that the enemy of your enemy is your friend, ""Pride"" should leave audiences smiling and inspired. But it would have been a much more groundbreaking film if it had been released 30 years ago."
1, The Holocaust has never looked so beautiful.
0," Cooper stomps around ineffectually, Stevens makes for a blandly tame suitor, and Browning is unable to ignite any chemistry with either. The scenery is stunning. But the swooning has all the heat of a midwinter's swim."
0, Let's not mince words: This movie stinks.
1, A convincing British found-footage horror that actually has some good performances and genuine scares.
0," The movie just keeps grinding along, pushing its way through a barrage of boom-boom and a sea of tight-lipped clichï¿½ï"
0," This Means War makes a decent date movie, but it doesn't have much to offer beyond the charm of Witherspoon, Hardy, and Pine."
0, ... a desultory mash-up of tones and styles. It doesn't really succeed as either melodrama or mystery. Tï¿½ï¿½chinï¿½ï¿½'s pacing is off and potentially incriminating information is jack-hammered int
1," A surprisingly solid, expertly constructed crime drama."
0, It's more a list of ingredients than a movie-magic potion to enjoy from start to finish.
0, Didn't need to be a movie.
0," When Hollywood bakes a pulp pastry like Daredevil, the dough that rises isn't simply the budget. You can feel your mind becoming a sponge cake, so porous that air whistles through it like wind."
1, This is probably the most fun to be had at the multiplex so far this year.
1, A rousing crowd pleaser about an underdog track team that can proudly takes its place among these other fine sports films.
0, Sitting through McCarthy's latest movie is about as pleasant as a punch to the face.
0," It's hard to mess up a car chase up and down the streets of San Francisco and Fleischer certainly doesn't, though at these speeds we should be gasping and laughing instead of just nodding our heads."
0," The boundlessness of the juvenile imagination is often treated as whimsical and wonderful, but in this Austrian shocker the fanciful ideas rattling around inside children's skulls grow hideously dark."
1," Cronenberg takes Josh Olson's script, based on a graphic novel by John Wagner and Vince Locke and pushes it to the psychological limits."
1," No, Cars 2 isn't another pearl from Pixar, but it's entertaining and well-made."
0," There's a sense throughout that the filmmakers don't quite know how to handle the line between fact and fiction, between prodding and simply observing."
1," Patricio Guzman's exquisitely filmed, pensively narrated and profoundly humanistic documentary explores Chile's remote Atacama Desert, revealing essential truths about the mysterious universe and the human experience within it."
1," Bottom line: The movie is terrific, just the breath of 1 air Warners needs."
1," In his latest effort, Storytelling, Solondz has finally made a movie that isn't just offensive -- it also happens to be good."
0, A cheerfully terrible January time-waster.
0," Dreadful, offensive!"
0," This sequel just comes off as rushed and very lazy in terms of plotting. If [the writers] had taken their time with it, they would have seen that the story is full of holes and that it was lacking the essential elements to engage the audience once more."
1," Evanescent and intangible, it dissolves into the air, leaving something tragic and mysterious behind."
1," Sometimes it seems that nobody ever has any idea what it is he's chasing after, and so the chase never ends.... It's a good day when you can laugh about it, which is what The Heartbreak Kid lets you do."
1, Very low-key but extremely well-acted. 
0, Well done for 100 minutes; then it completely falls apart.
1, It's stunningly ambitious and thrillingly alive the way the best movies are.
1," An impressionistic, poetic cosmic journey that asks far more questions than it answers, many of them in Malick's by now familiar quasi-religious rhetorical style."
1," Lots of violence, some language in Western road movie. "
1," ...if a movie makes me laugh hard, and particularly if it does so on purpose, I call that good enough."
0," t's hard to sit back and embrace the chaos of ""The Last Knight"" when you can think about similar big-budget action tentpoles ... and reflect on how even in all their craziness, they just made a lot more sense."
0, Geostorm is utterly ridiculous.
0, Thoroughly mediocre.
0," Unbroken ends up telling only a fraction of Louis Zamperini's remarkable life story. By focusing on the most extreme parts of it, he becomes a symbol rather than a three-dimensional person."
0, I suppose the best thing to be said for The Killing of a Sacred Deer is that it would be even worse if we cared about any of the people in it.
1," Four Heavenly Kings is more coherent than Demons Strike Back, and better in just about every way than Dunjia, and its effects are as imaginative as anything in cinema today..."
0," Represents a lost opportunity to give children, not to mention adults, a movie experience that would widen their eyes as the justly beloved Rowling books did."
1," The Light Between Oceans occasionally pushes too hard in its desire to make you feel, but those moments can be forgiven thanks to the general emotional impact. "
0," It is so bad that it could well rival the infamous ""Star Wars Holiday Special"" as the single most useless piece of ""Star Wars""-related entertainment ever made and at least in that legendary disaster, the animated aspect was actually not too bad."
1," A solid, dependably scary ghost tale."
0, Sully is a character study that doesn't tell us much about the character. Other than the fact that he is a hero. Which we already knew.
0, Not the worst movie ever made -- no thanks to Latifah.
1," Thankfully, Paul Rudd as Ant-Man is as engaging as ever. He almost single-handedly saves this sequel, which is genial enough but not nearly as much fun as the original."
0," To the degree that the film works, it's because Costner plays the straight man."
0," With pedestrian direction provided by SNL veteran Dave McCary, Mooney and company drop the ball just when they decide to ground James in the world he left behind."
0," [It's] admittedly funnier than the 2006 original. But that movie was so dispiritingly, soul-suckingly bad, there was nowhere left to go but up."
1," Lily Tomlin is a tridimensional and unforgettable character, you cant keep your eyes off the screen. [Full review in Spanish]"
0," A lurching, stuttering drama, one whose intentions are far better than its sense of storytelling rhythm."
1, I truly enjoyed it from start to finish.
1," Though I admit the title of the film is slightly dumb, I can't really fault much else going on here."
1," This is yet another demonstration of the staggering versatility of Auteuil, surely the finest French actor of his generation."
0, I challenge you to name another movie about an alien robot come to save the world while disguised as a yellow Camaro. Isn't it just an intergalactic Herbie the Love Bug?
0," The Cave is a rare find, a film that is pure formula, yet impossible to follow."
0, Ends up stepping on dog poop.... .
1," If you like seeing authentically unusual movies, then ignore the haters: In its fusion of disparate genres, its sentimentality, and its weirdness, Serenity is actually worth watching."
1, This is storytelling as lean and unpredictable as a fighting dog; it's one of the strongest first features I have seen this year.
0, Will leave audiences cold and not a little depressed.
0," Dead Night ends up being muddled, never committing to either solemn supernatural horror or its elements of camp."
0," 2014: Annie's America makes director John Huston's elephantine, synthetically charismatic 1982 adaptation look like a Minnelliesque model of focus and concision."
1," A film as mournful as it is amusing, one that forces even a seasoned agent provocateur like Moore to admit that he cannot answer the questions he poses."
1, A Kooky Virgin. The 40-Year-Old Virgin is comedy's best bet this season.
1," In adapting Antonio di Benedetto's 1956 novel for the screen, writer-director [Lucrecia] Martel offers a very different perspective on the colonial experience."
0," The concept has been done before, and better, most notably by...Vigalondo in ""Time Crimes,"" but Dammen's gang that literally can't shoot straight is so clueless, rooting for his bumbling protagonist proves an entertaining, if trifling, amusement."
1, An enjoyable date movie.
0, You've seen it all before.
0," Adivi Sesh does an underwhelming job in portraying a wannabe spy, and he is more unconvincing as a rouge field agent who is on the run."
1," A character-driven drama of actual import that delivers a message and dramatic punch, but with a visual edginess and narrative ingenuity that is in the service of the story, as opposed to the filmmaker's cleverness."
0," If only McCorkle had a bit more, er, faith in his audience."
1," The violence is outdated by today's standards, but the original Chainsaw still packs a punch with its rough look and disturbing overtones."
0, No one seems to realize they are supposed to have a little fun with this material.
0, As bland as corn flakes.
1," Although the film touches all the formula bases, its characters are strong, the thrills and laughs are doled out regularly and its emotional arc is tangible and true."
1," ""First Reformed"" takes some wild, unexpected and uncomfortable turns in its final act that will surely shock some, anger others and disturb just about everyone. For Schrader, it shows that he's still got it. Welcome back."
1," While it lacks some of the more profound observations of Kore-eda's best work, the filmmaker's more gentle approach still allows his subtle humanity to shine through."
1," ""A movie that believes it's more radical than it actually is."""
1," ...that rare film that delivers truly intelligent, original entertainment, with all credit to Lebowitz. "
1, The best thing that either Matt Damon and director Ridley Scott have done in years.
1," The ability of ""People's Republic of Desire"" to show these familiar desires playing out in futuristic surroundings is invariably surprising and never less than compelling."
1," Two vaguely amoral do-gooders do their part to fight Commies in a secret hot war during a cold one%u2026you know, the one that installed the Taliban in Afghanistan and turned it into a place armed to the teeth and crazy pissed at us. Then Sorkin and Nich"
1," Sure, we all know how it's going to end, but with Disney finding their classic groove again, who honestly cares?"
0, Maybe just rewatch The Fifth Element instead.
0, Maybe I am just getting too old for this stuff.
1," As a director, Gordon-Levitt demonstrates considerable technical flair through stylistic flourishes and coaxes great performances out of his co-stars."
0, [Goes] on too long and has too many endings.
0," Had the filmmakers spent as much time to developing the story as they did to lame in-jokes and an annoying post-credits coda, X-Men: The Last Stand wouldn't have seemed like an inferior clone of the previous mutant masterpieces."
0," How She Move, quite simply, doesn't move. Instead, the dreary, familiar tale unspools in painfully static fashion. If there's a glimmer of imagination here, it's not visible in the finished product."
0, There's a sense throughout of Steve James rushing and dutifully covering all his bases to evade accusations of creating a puff piece.
0," A movie made with awards season in mind, ""Changeling"" offers extravagant affects and overwritten speeches."
0, A clunker from an immensely gifted filmmaker.
1," Although the 'jiggery-pokery' does mute the 'actual, horrible story,' Bergman still poses worthy questions, offering no answers, a key difference between art and baloney, or spirituality and dogmatism."
1, Jackson's ... fire-and-brimstone delivery adds a much-needed edge to the inspirational cliches.
0," The 3D cinematography is occasionally impressive, but in most other respects Australian made cave-diving adventure Sanctum is a disappointingly hackneyed genre outing."
1," We're stuck on the ledge, waiting to see if Paul will jump. Painful, but good."
0, Never before has such a simple story with so few players been so deliberately hard to follow.
0," Overall ""Take Me Home Tonight"" represents a lateral move at best for its 24-hour party people, a step back at worst, and not worth your time either way."
0," Elba is genuinely great as the tormented Roland, but the film does its best to suffocate him under a mountain of plot-heavy nonsense. Disappointing."
0, It's pretty sad if you're a comic and Al Pacino is the funniest thing in your movie.
0," Though the movie is a literate adventure story, the series' dark tone is lightened up in the film just enough to make one yearn for the darkly twisted witticisms and pervasive anxiety that made Handler's books uniquely appealing."
1," The filmmakers probably thought the truth would be too upsetting for children, so we get walrus farts instead."
0, Perhaps writer-director Roland Emmerich was hoping for a so-bad-it's-good cult status with his latest disaster flick.
1," Fans of The Twilight Zone and The Outer Limits will particularly appreciate this blend of clever mystery, offbeat wit and a deeper-than-usual observational analysis of relationships and marital ennui."
1," Actually, this comic romp is for everybody."
1," The more I see of Adam Sandler, the more I appreciate his talent."
1, There are some rollicky moments in Finding Dory... [But] the inventiveness of the animation is not matched by the frayed workmanship of the story line.
0," It offers a good amount of crowd-pleasing action, but the story is convoluted and the heroes are scowling mannequins."
0," Stillborn, pointless piece of work."
0, A lack of memorable moments or original components makes Ouija: Origin Of Evil feel completely forgettable
1, Morgan Spurlock shows he can be as entertaining a documentary film-maker as Michael Moore.
0," It's the craziest of the YA dystopia movies by far, taking the premise of ""child murder as entertainment"" to new, un-dreamed-of heights."
1, The heist in Rififi is a dazzling and suspenseful set-piece.
1, The rest of the film has similar fun mixing bug-world givens with anthropomorphism.
1, Hounddog boasts a distinctive wood-and-emerald look and several crackerjack performances.
0," Has strong performances and exquisite cinematography, but feels too bland, maudlin and ultimately underwhelming."
0, These men know comedy. So I cannot for the life of me comprehend what trusted adviser or dollar amount (or automatic weapon) persuaded them to sign on to this mess of a movie.
0," Watching Machete is like nodding smugly for 100 minutes in a hall of mirrors, with nothing but fragmented glimpses of hollow satisfaction as a reward."
1," A high-spirited, synthetically raucous house-party comedy."
0," ...nicely atmospheric, but the atmosphere isn't quite enough to sustain interest in the absence of fright."
0," The paradoxically loose, yet unadventurous approach of director Paul Feig smothers most opportunities for set-piece scenes to rise above a preordained average outcome."
0, More entertaining in concept than execution.
1," Woody Allen's latest is a pure relationship-fest, but the audience can't help but be transfixed ( a little threatened?) by Bardem's stare. A thoroughbred cast and crew makes a very watchable romantic tryst, but no classic."
0, There are about two or three different films fighting for control of the screen during David Gordon Green's powerful but flawed Snow Angels
1," Where action movies are equated with popcorn, Last Vegas is comfort food. It's not terribly good for you, but it sure tastes good."
1," Amazingly, this vigorous effort is the first feature film of M. Truffaut, who had previously been (of all things!) the movie critic for a French magazine."
0," [Director] Antal's slickly edited, fast-moving style is the best thing about this otherwise-cliched movie."
0, I just did not get pulled in.
1," What Scherman achieves is a bigger picture of World War I and the toll it takes on soldiers, all from underground with only a few individuals."
0, Witless even by slasher-film standards.
1," This slender, but sweet buddy comedy boasts lovely 2D animation, a great story and, best of all, a distinctly original world that keeps revealing new surprises. "
1," A perspicaciously empathetic study of solitude, depression and anxiety."
0," Under the guidance of director Andy Fickman, lessons are learned. Perhaps the most important is that the adult stars, who do the best they can with the material, should stick to animated voice work until they can find less demeaning projects."
1, It's a beautifully observed rite-of-passage and culture-clash story.
0," Perhaps MacLachlan was after a visual vocabulary that was as limited as his film's dialogue. In doing so, he's sold his story short. This crop feels like it needed more time to come out of the ground."
0," Haneke has rational reasons for his movie's violence, but he still crosses lines more often than he justifies crossing them."
1, It will stick with you for days (or even weeks) after you see it. I can't get the damn thing out of my head.
1," Working again in his native Baltimore, the writer-director maintains the documentary-style feel for place that has infused all his features."
1," There is Oscar-caliber work at almost all levels here, beginning with the exceptional adaptation by Tykwer."
0," The film, based on the novel by Gayle Forman, is an almost deliberate confirmation of Alison Bechdel's claim that women in film are so often shown only in relation to men."
0," Why hire Fanning, a gifted performer under the right circumstances, and then waste her presence on a nothing role?"
1, Hunger and Shame were mimetic where 12 Years a Slave is diegetic.
1," The new characters may not have the human qualities the others had the souls and personalities. However, they are interesting enough and true to the tales spun by Baum in The Land of Oz (1904) and Ozma of Oz (1907)."
1, This Is It gives us a fuller portrait of the man and his passion than we've ever seen before. But don't think it lets us finally understand him.
1," ...funny, sharp, and breathlessly paced, and is one of the few films this year that are worth the exuberant price of a current 3D ticket. Bring on X-men: Apocalypse."
0," Robinson deserves a movie that's polished where this one is haphazard, but he needs to be able to cut loose instead of being reduced to the confusion and blanching he is often called upon to do in this one."
1, Thumpingly exhilarating ...
0," Expectations can be a bad thing for movies, and Burke And Hare is a good example of this."
0, ...this essentially feels like an extended episode of the series...
0," works well enough, but mostly in workman-like fashion that never becomes truly rousing"
0," We're meant to laugh at the fact that cute little Stephanie bumbles her way to getting one informant killed and another savagely beaten and thrown from a moving vehicle. Oh Stephanie, you're a riot!"
0, [An] aimless period drama.
1," It was the supporting players who really grabbed me, especially Amy Adams (effectively blending her Drop Dead Gorgeous and The Master characters into one person)..."
1," Writer-director Dan Gilroy create a compelling portrait of a slick hustler straight out of What Makes Sammy Run?, prowling the garish neon mean streets instead of the studios of Hollywood, willing to stoop to anything, even murder."
0," wooden performances, banal dialogue, and unintentional humor, the whole thing plummets to a denouement full of sound and fury like the film itself, signifying, well, you know."
0, High-minded thriller about professional paranormal debunkers gets off to a strong start but loses focus halfway through.
1," Skyfall is inconsistent, displaying Bond at its blandest and Bond at its best."
1," Alex Lawther delivers a ""Blair Witch/Insidious"" level of terrified that becomes a new yardstick to measure horror movie acting against."
0," Learning your visuals from Jack Kirby is one thing, but too often it sounds like Cameron learned to write dialogue from the guy too."
1," In moving away from the dirty arena of polemics, Sicko accomplishes something Moore has sought for quite some time: coherence."
1," Unlike many recent superhero movies, Silver Surfer doesn't have a heavy, overblown quality. For the most part, it's light and playful (and short, clocking in at a brisk 90 minutes)."
1," It is edgy, perhaps, but those edges are softened by the director's clear affection for his characters, and that's not a bad thing at all."
0," Never seems to quite know what's on its mind, though individual scenes (a cool battle on the ice) have their moments."
1," As tough as the subject matter may get at times, the film is guaranteed to be an uplifting one for viewers of all ages, with its emphasis placed on the joy of its subjects, whether it be in their everyday life or in the midst of their creative process."
0," Entebbe would have been far better served to simply tell the story of what happened, not set a stage for political speechifying. Every other movie about Israel does that, you'd think if any story could stay focused on some glory it would be this one."
0," Direction lacks the strong hand of To's solo efforts, and pic shows some signs of rush, with abrupt transitions and lack of flow in the editing."
1," It is more intriguing than a lot of fiction, and told in a more compelling manner than most film stories."
1," Big, bold performances make for lots of Tolstoy fun. As long as you don't mind a little melodrama and everyone talking with British and Scottish accents."
1," [Actor Alfred] Castro, giving Robert De Niro a run for his money, has taken the anti-hero to an insidious extreme."
1," Some would say that it's 'Schadenfreude,' a fascination with disaster, that keeps us watching...But this film provides rare insight into the failure of a American family..."
1," While it doesn't always stick the landing and the plot threads feel a little clumsily tied, The Way, Way Back succeeds where it counts with its big, sloppy heart."
1," ...an entertaining story that doesn't mind playing things sinister, while keeping things light at the same time..."
0," For some real insight into the sad demise of ""Susan Superstar"" read Jean Stein's eye-opening 'Edie: American Girl,' or rent ""Ciao! Manhattan"" instead."
0," [S]pends more than half of its running time establishing these characters, only to turn them into personality-deprived pawns when they actually have to do something."
0, Harrowing scenes of carnage and death still fascinate Bay more than personal stories or political complexity so it makes for an exhausting watch that never lets up and rarely provides any contrast to the heat of battle.
1, An eye-popping animated extravaganza.
0, You might be better off reading the book and imagining [Nick] Nolte as Socrates.
0," Mel Gibson's Kurt tries to tell kids a joke about ""two dead hookers"" (i.e. violence against women) and mentors his grandson on how to grope."
0," [Wall's] visually unimaginative style ... may work, barely, in increments of fifteen minutes or less, but fails to engage over 90 minutes on the big screen."
0," By the end, we're left with a feeling of depletion rather than resolution."
0," Stacy Peralta, this is your life. Again. And again."
1," An astonishing story, well told. "
1, Why strip things down when you can just add more?!
1, This glossy romantic comedy gets off to a good start...[but] some of the storylines are slack...
0," During the final half hour, everything that's compelling about this low-budget thriller collapses in a miasma of idiocy."
1, [Lambert & Stamp] will mean the most for those with a deep appreciation for the minutiae of British rock 40 years ago.
0," When a Die Hard movie doesn't have a single well-staged action sequence, you know something went badly wrong."
1," Slackers, Rejoice! Makes the comedy honor roll for being inventive and riotously funny."
1," Inspiring docu on hip-hop's roots has some violence, cursing "
1, An ambitious love letter to a Louisiana way of life that's being literally washed away.
0, Vacuous excavation yarn set in 1900 Egypt.
0," Except for Ms. Janney's monstrous mother and an Alzheimer's-afflicted grandmother (Polly Bergen), ""Struck by Lightning"" gives its characters no dimension."
1," It's talky, foul-mouthed, over-the-top and probably too long by at least a half hour. However, those who enjoy Tarantino's brand of off-the-wall filmmaking and those who can withstand this film's constant assault on their sensibilities will be just fine."
1," It's a movie about coming to peace with solitude, leagues beyond most biopics."
1," The script, written by Refn, Mary Laws and Polly Stenham, may not hold up when put under scrutiny, but at least what's on screen is pretty."
1, Pleasant throwback to eighties John Hughes flicks. 
0, Mid90s feels like an exercise in nostalgia and nothing more.
1, This may get some in the audience to dream of doing more creative things with their free time than just going to the movies.
1," Noirish touches flesh out the wispy plot, yet it's the old-school animation that engages most: lending clarity to the emotions at stake, ensuring our sickly hero's resilience tugs on the heart."
0," As befits its title, this PG-13-rated piffle is ultimately as threatening as the Snuggle Fabric Softener bear."
0," The Village is a colossal miscalculation, a movie based on a premise that cannot support it, a premise so transparent it would be laughable were the movie not so deadly solemn."
0," Simply put, ""Day"" is a mess Cavill never rises above."
1," The glimpse into an exotic, edgy world is absorbing and the performances of Damon, Norton and Landau are rewarding, despite the shaky credibility of their characters' relationships."
0," Let down by a lazy script, a lacklustre leading performance from Minka Kelly and a frustrating tendency to cop out of the expected nasty moments."
0," Ultimately the one who gets burned is Cage, a 1996 Oscar winner whose once-promising career is boarding the mother ship for oblivion."
1," Five films in, Pirates still leaves you feeling a lot like the Magic Kingdom ride it's so famously inspired by: alternately thrilled, exhausted, and seriously regretting that last funnel cake."
1," Green Inferno's scenes of gore and repulsion make up for its lackadaisical plot and lackluster characters, who you will ultimately actually enjoy seeing ripped to shreds."
1, Features a far more soulful and charismatic Jaa immersed in a ceaseless whoosh of extraordinary fight scenes involving everything from pebbles to elephants.
1," As far as by-the-numbers, big-budget major studio comedies go, Office Christmas Party is perfectly adequate."
0," The cast works hard, but they still end up phoning it in."
0, Director Dennis Dugan is to screen comedy what the atomic bomb was to Nagasaki.
0, It's so hilariously inept that it's almost worth watching.
0," It's a shame that Loznitsa decides to be so obvious, as one of the great attributes of direct cinema is that it treats the audience as intelligent people and trusts them to reach their own conclusions."
0," Seyfried gets by on three expressions -- wonder, bewilderment and a frozen-faced commingling of both."
0," Butler's dark gusto is unexplained, and his character lacks the charisma and one-liners of fellow macho world-savers Rambo, James Bond and John McClane."
1," As mad and chaotic as the times we live in, it proves that laughter and hope go hand in hand."
0," Freddie Prinze, Jr. simply smiled and giggled his way through the picture."
1," Submarine successfully combines the quirky and the sweet, in this representation of adolescence in all of its messy, overdramatic, and bumbling glory. "
0," Quite simply, what we have here is a romantic comedy that is neither."
1," The other actors do their best to help Fiennes define this curious anti-hero. Incapable of playing the role of peacetime compromiser, his Coriolanus comes across as a warrior who simply can't function without a war."
1," Amazing adventure, colour explosions and catchy songs. This is amazing."
0," These bodies, whether human or zombie, feel room-temperature at best."
1, Horror masterpiece definitely isn't for young kids.
0, The movie turned my stomach.
0, Only the sublimely snakey Grant emerges unscathed
1," In Nervous Translation, the [director Shireen Seno] processes the uncertainty and confusion -- the nervousness -- of the moment, filtering it -- and translating it -- through its own magical lens. [Full review in Spanish]"
0," There was no need for this movie at all, except, perhaps, to finance paving Bruckheimer's driveway in gold leaf. And really, Johnny, how many chateaux in France do you need?"
0, A dated counterculture goulash long hyped as art by a blank generation desperate for something different.
1," Can't Buy Me Love for the Mean Girls generation. It knows it and it references that movie and other '80s classics, but Can't Buy Me Love is the accurate one because it's really about changing people's lives."
1," The movie does not offer a clean-cut look at morality and heroes, who emerge from a reluctant position, but it does draw a definitive line between good and evil."
0," Bobby's decision-making throughout is operatic (with grand gestures and tears and sensational lighting), but also crude and flatfooted."
1," There's something about Love, Simon that feels like a bona fide event...It's a film that we swooned and winced and cringed and grinned through, the journey the best coming-of-age movies take their audiences on. "
1, [A] charmingly offbeat rom-com.
1, One part allegory on familial tensions and one part commentary on environmental and biological poisoning.
0, All the onscreen transgressions are so tightly packed into the film's 80 minutes that they play as increasingly ludicrous and unbelievable examples of community unrest.
0," An entertaining but frustrating film. There are some good performances, and some great music, but the movie is too jumbled and confused to reach the heights to which it aspires."
1," The filmmakers have crafted a canny delivery system for their life lessons, by way of a movie that balances escapism, candor and ethics with admirable aplomb."
1, Close might well receive a seventh Academy Award nomination for The Wife.
0," Natalya Pavlenkova gives a wonderful performance, but the movie around her merely coasts along on its surface weirdness."
1," This is a bold, blackly comic masterpiece -- everyone should see it."
0," Each performer gets more-or-less comic traits to work to death, but [Jack] Black is the only one who comes close to inspired lunacy as the formerly attractive girl appalled, yet intrigued, by her new male equipment"
1, The most subtle comic adaptation you'll see all year.
1," For all the 1940s hokiness of 42, with its big cars and big bands and peanuts and Cracker Jack, it's a wonderful surprise to see that there's a recognizable human being at the center of the hoopla."
0," From a general outline, the story here is fascinating and worth telling (especially on the big screen), but the journey of Chuck is full of bumps, bruises, and bleeding"
0," The little guys [the filmmakers' target audience] are going to be thrilled with the adventure, the plethora of critters and their bright colors."
1," Annihilation won't be for everyone, but those willing to give it a chance will be treated with sci-fi they can sink their teeth into a la Arrival or Under the Skin."
0, Utter garbage. The kids will love it.
0," When music takes over, a film straining to be down has all the pizzazz of an Up with People production."
0, Embarrassing for everyone involved.
0," I laughed sporadically throughout, but not enough to call it a successful comedy. There are too many dead spots, and that first half hour is unwatchable."
0," Somewhere, another eight-year-old girl is dreaming of being a filmmaker. Ocean's 8 won't be the kick of inspiration she needs, unless the message she takes away is: You can do better than this."
1," Horns is best described as a grown-up fairy tale, with all the sex and violence that implies. It's not Grimm, but it is grim. It's also an enjoyable and original story, which these days is almost a kind of magical experience in itself."
1," It remains an influence on the modern blockbuster, and is one of its best examples."
1, Blair's sharp injection of pace helps to zip past any cliches so fast that you don't have much time to register them.
1," At any rate, you're not going to bump into anything else this year that resembles it much at all."
1," If you liked the first one, you'll positively love this next instalment in the straight-faced action franchise starring Keanu Reeves as a hitman who absolutely everybody wants to kill."
0, This is the kind of pointless teen schlock one sees on USA Up All Night.
0," What does that say when a self-admitted narcissist receives such a following? In playing the victim card so often, Sarah Jessica Parker's character is one of the most unlikable characters I've seen in a long time."
0," The special effects are skillfully wrought, scary and exciting. But when the story focuses on those weathering the onslaught, things are far less thrilling."
0, Aa movie that expects you to bring more to the movie than the movie brings to you...runs out of ideas long before it runs out of movie.
0," Overwritten and overlit, ""Lez Bomb"" frequently undercuts its own charms."
1, A compelling low-budget film which would have been even better if co-writer Marling could wean herself off an infatuation with infuriating conclusions.
1," Packs a poignent punch, but could have delved deeper."
1," A good option for kids, if it's okay for your children to come into contact with a little bit of eschatological humor. [Full review in Spanish]"
1," There's so much to like in Denzel Washington's new movie, it's easier to accentuate the positive."
0, Its job is to deliver a few jolty thrills and a couple of laughs and wrap things up before it starts to get too dumb.
1," ...captures the mysterious beauty of Petit's obsession, without ever being so gauche as to 'explain' it."
1," Actors Ineson, Dickie and Anya Taylor-Joy exult in the archaic language, delivering powerful performances in this fairy tale of a family given a glimpse of the forces that lurk on the edge of the civilised world."
0, A sporadically agreeable misfire...
0, Actors in tights declaim in bloodless BBC accents while someone murders a piano's sustain pedal on the soundtrack.
1," Lottery Ticket sags in its middle buts its energy, comedy and characters also provide much entertainment."
1," Persepolis creates a 1 approach to interpreting the graphic novel format, taking cues from the experiences of illustrator Marjane Satrapi."
0," This is slightly more of a disappointment than the previous instalments, largely because (Banderas aside) it never gives any of the cast anything to do. "
0," The lack of a strong inner conflict or neurosis for Lily ... makes the resolution of ""Pali Road"" prosaic, a lost opportunity."
0," ""Out of Blue"" doesn't strike out only as an adaptation. What it offers on its own is tepid and predictable."
0," It's debatable whether or not ""Martyrs"" worked the first time around, but it certainly doesn't hold up during a second pass."
0," Although director Renny Harlin clearly knows his way around an action scene, he fails to make Deep seem, well, deep."
0, There's a solid 95-minute movie buried somewhere in here.
0," I have fond memories of Louis Leterrier's cheerfully ridiculous 2013 caper Now You See Me, but I didn't really need another one."
0," At this advanced level of sophistication, one starts to wonder if Abdi Nazemian and Micah Schraft's screenplay was written entirely in capital letters. Or perhaps crayon?"
1," A starting point for acts of kindness and of joy and remembering. And given Miguel's sunny optimism and all-embracing love, Coco is superior holiday viewing."
1," Oversimpliies matters somewhat, but...the subject is an extremely timely one, and it presents an extremely important side of it quite persuasively."
0, It's the filmic equivalent of hot sauce that's spicy but doesn't have any flavor.
0, Lost Souls is wretched.
1," Beauty, obsession and longing are the central themes of this hypnotic but ultimately flawed drama in which Ben Kingsley's ageing college professor falls in lust with Penelope Cruz' stunning and vulnerable student."
1," The camera only loves the man himself, perhaps a measure of his stardom, or otherwise that was what the Colonel wanted."
1," Normally it's a terrible thing if a film only gives us one good character ... except when it's Indiana Jones, with a whip at his side. A terrible story can't totally ruin Jones. Thank God."
1," Inferior to the two previous Lego movies, yet funny and entertaining enough for the younger crowd. [Full review in Spanish]"
0," This cloying, fractured slop of uninspired swill is content to swim among summer's worst."
1, Wrapped around the cool and dark character study at the heart of 'Phantom Thread' is some impressively picturesque packaging.
0," In the multiverse of its alternate iterations, Paris Is Us could have been a sci-fi take on parallel universes, a fatalistic romance, or even a thoughtful interrogation of life in Paris in 2015. Too bad it never made up its mind. "
0," The Possession offers a steady stream of chuckles and a few big laughs. Unfortunately, it isn't a comedy ..."
1," As always, Gromit, as doggedly silent and resourceful as Buster Keaton, is the true hero, and the rousing finale is far and away his finest hour."
0," For all its technical virtuosity, the film is so mired in juvenile and near-xenophobic pedagogy that it's enough to make one pine for the day when Godard can no longer handle the rigors of filmmaking."
1, The story remains fully accessible yet shrouded in mystery.
1," Clocking in at a crisp, succinct 80 minutes, The Babysitter is an enjoyable, breezy film that doesn't take itself too seriously."
1," Milner and Poulter are a lot of fun to watch, a pair of first-timer naturals who don't reek of Dakota Fanning Young Actorliness."
0," Atrocious dialogue, gross clichï¿½ï¿½s, absurd plot twists and ludicrous orchestral flouris"
